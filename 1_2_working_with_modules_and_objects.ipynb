Therefore, we do NOT keep these books\\r\\nin compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\\r\\nof the official release dates, for time for better editing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\\r\\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\\r\\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\\r\\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\\r\\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\\r\\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\\r\\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\\r\\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\\r\\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\\r\\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\\r\\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\\r\\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\\r\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\r\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\\r\\nfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+\\r\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\r\\ntotal should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\r\\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\\r\\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\\r\\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\r\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Single, my dear, to be sure!  A single man of large\\r\\nfortune; four or five thousand a year.  What a fine thing for our\\r\\ngirls!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so?  How can it affect them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so\\r\\n tiresome!  You must know that I am thinking of his marrying\\r\\none of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Design!  Nonsense, how can you talk so!  But it is very likely\\r\\nthat he MAY fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\r\\nmust visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see no occasion for that.  You and the girls may go, or you\\r\\nmay send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still\\r\\nbetter, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley\\r\\nmay like you the best of the party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, you flatter me.  I certainly HAVE had my share of\\r\\nbeauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\r\\nWhen a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give\\r\\nover thinking of her own beauty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think\\r\\nof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when\\r\\nhe comes into the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But consider your daughters.  Only think what an\\r\\nestablishment it would be for one of them.  Sir William and\\r\\nLady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for\\r\\nin general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you\\r\\nmust go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do\\r\\nnot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely.  I dare say Mr. Bingley will\\r\\nbe very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\r\\nassure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\r\\nchooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for\\r\\n my little Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing.  Lizzy is not a bit better\\r\\nthan the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\r\\nJane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\r\\ngiving HER the preference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied\\r\\nhe; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\r\\nsomething more of quickness than her sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a\\r\\nway?  You take delight in vexing me.  You have no compassion\\r\\nfor my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mistake me, my dear.  I have a high respect for your\\r\\nnerves.  They are my old friends.  I have heard you mention\\r\\nthem with consideration these last twenty years at least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic\\r\\nhumour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-\\r\\ntwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand\\r\\nhis character.  HER mind was less difficult to develop.  She was\\r\\na woman of mean understanding, little information, and\\r\\nuncertain temper.  When she was discontented, she fancied\\r\\nherself nervous.  The business of her life was to get her\\r\\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\r\\nalways assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\r\\nevening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.  It\\r\\nwas then disclosed in the following manner: --Observing his\\r\\nsecond daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly\\r\\naddressed her with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes,\" said\\r\\nher mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet\\r\\nhim at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.  She has two\\r\\nnieces of her own.  She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\r\\nhave no opinion of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that\\r\\nyou do not depend on her serving you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to\\r\\ncontain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\\'s sake!  Have a little\\r\\ncompassion on my nerves.  You tear them to pieces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she\\r\\ntimes them ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully.\\r\\n\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come\\r\\nback till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to\\r\\nintroduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\r\\nintroduce Mr. Bingley to HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\r\\nwith him myself; how can you be so teasing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I honour your circumspection.  A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is\\r\\ncertainly very little.  One cannot know what a man really is by\\r\\nthe end of a fortnight. But if WE do not venture somebody else\\r\\nwill; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their\\r\\nchance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if\\r\\nyou decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\r\\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried\\r\\nhe.  \"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress\\r\\nthat is laid on them, as nonsense?  I cannot quite agree with you\\r\\nTHERE. What say you, Mary?  For you are a young lady of\\r\\ndeep reflection, I know, and read great books and make\\r\\nextracts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that\\r\\nbefore?  If I had known as much this morning I certainly would\\r\\nnot have called on him.  It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\r\\npaid the visit; we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first\\r\\ntumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\r\\nhad expected all the while.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!  But I knew I\\r\\nshould\\r\\npersuade you at last.  I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\r\\nneglect such an acquaintance.  Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\r\\nsuch a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning\\r\\nand never said a word about it till now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said Mr.\\r\\nBennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\r\\nraptures of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when the\\r\\ndoor was shut.  \"I do not know how you will ever make him\\r\\namends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.  At our\\r\\ntime of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\r\\nacquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\r\\nanything.  Lydia, my love, though you ARE the youngest, I dare\\r\\nsay Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I AM the\\r\\nyoungest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\r\\nwould return Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and determining when they\\r\\nshould ask him to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\r\\nfive daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\r\\nfrom her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\r\\nThey attacked him in various way-- with barefaced questions,\\r\\ningenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\r\\nskill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the\\r\\nsecond-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.  Her\\r\\nreport was highly favourable.  Sir William had been delighted\\r\\nwith him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome,\\r\\nextremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be\\r\\nat the next assembly with a large party.  Nothing could be more\\r\\ndelightful!  To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards\\r\\nfalling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\\'s heart\\r\\nwere entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\r\\nNetherfield,\" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the\\r\\nothers equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and sat\\r\\nabout ten minutes with him in his library.  He had entertained\\r\\nhopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of\\r\\nwhose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.\\r\\nThe ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the\\r\\nadvantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore\\r\\na blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\r\\nalready had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\r\\ncredit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which\\r\\ndeferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the\\r\\nfollowing day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour\\r\\nof their invitation, etc.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.\\r\\nShe could not imagine what business he could have in town so\\r\\nsoon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear\\r\\nthat he might be always flying about from one place to another,\\r\\nand never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas\\r\\nquieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone\\r\\nto London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report\\r\\nsoon followed, that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\\r\\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly.  The girls grieved\\r\\nover such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day\\r\\nbefore the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought\\r\\nonly six with him from London-- his five sisters and a cousin.\\r\\nAnd when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of\\r\\nonly five altogether-- Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband\\r\\nof the eldest, and another young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a\\r\\npleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.  His\\r\\nsisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.  His\\r\\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but\\r\\nhis friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by\\r\\nhis fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the\\r\\nreport which was in general circulation within five minutes\\r\\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The\\r\\ngentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the\\r\\nladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and\\r\\nhe was looked at with great admiration for about half the\\r\\nevening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of\\r\\nhis popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above\\r\\nhis company, and above being pleased; and not all his large\\r\\nestate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\r\\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to\\r\\nbe compared with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\r\\nprincipal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\r\\ndanced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,\\r\\nand talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable\\r\\nqualities must speak for themselves.  What a contrast between\\r\\nhim and his friend!  Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.\\r\\nHurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced\\r\\nto any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking\\r\\nabout the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\r\\nHis character was decided.  He was the proudest, most\\r\\ndisagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he\\r\\nwould never come there again.  Amongst the most violent\\r\\nagainst him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general\\r\\nbehaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\r\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of\\r\\ngentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that\\r\\ntime, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear\\r\\na conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from\\r\\nthe dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance.  I hate to see\\r\\nyou standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.  You had\\r\\nmuch better dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it, unless I am\\r\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner.  At such an assembly as\\r\\nthis it would be insupportable.  Your sisters are engaged, and\\r\\nthere is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\r\\npunishment to me to stand up with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley,\\r\\n\"for a kingdom!  Upon my honour, I never met with so many\\r\\npleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are\\r\\nseveral of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!  But\\r\\nthere is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is\\r\\nvery pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my\\r\\npartner to introduce you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a\\r\\nmoment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own\\r\\nand coldly said:  \"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to\\r\\ntempt ME; I am in no humour at present to give consequence\\r\\nto young ladies who are slighted by other men.  You had better\\r\\nreturn to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting\\r\\nyour time with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\r\\nElizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.\\r\\nShe told the story, however, with great spirit among her\\r\\nfriends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted\\r\\nin anything ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole\\r\\nfamily.  Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much\\r\\nadmired by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with\\r\\nher twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane\\r\\nwas as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in\\r\\na quieter way.  Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s pleasure.  Mary had heard\\r\\nherself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished\\r\\ngirl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\r\\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all\\r\\nthat they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned,\\r\\ntherefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they\\r\\nlived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.  They\\r\\nfound Mr. Bennet still up.  With a book he was regardless of\\r\\ntime; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of\\r\\ncuriosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such\\r\\nsplendid expectations.  He had rather hoped that his wife\\'s\\r\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon\\r\\nfound out that he had a different story to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have\\r\\nhad a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.  I wish you\\r\\nhad been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\r\\nEverybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought\\r\\nher quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!  Only think of\\r\\nTHAT, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was\\r\\nthe only creature in the room that he asked a second time.\\r\\nFirst of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to see him\\r\\nstand up with her!  But, however, he did not admire her at all;\\r\\nindeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with\\r\\nJane as she was going down the dance.  So he inquired who she\\r\\nwas, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.  Then\\r\\nthe two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with\\r\\n Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two\\r\\nsixth with Lizzy, and the BOULANGER--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he had had any compassion for ME,\" cried her husband\\r\\nimpatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much!  For God\\'s\\r\\nsake, say no more of his partners.  O that he had\\r\\nsprained his ankle in the first place!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him.  He is so\\r\\nexcessively handsome!  And his sisters are charming women.  I\\r\\nnever in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.  I\\r\\ndare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst\\'s gown--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she was interrupted again.  Mr. Bennet protested against\\r\\nany description of finery.  She was therefore obliged to seek\\r\\nanother branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness\\r\\nof spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose\\r\\nmuch by not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable,\\r\\nhorrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So high and so conceited\\r\\nthat there was no enduring him!  He walked here, and he\\r\\nwalked there, fancying himself so very great!  Not handsome\\r\\nenough to dance with!  I wish you had been there, my dear, to\\r\\nhave given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\r\\ncautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\r\\nsister just how very much she admired him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\\r\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--\\r\\nso much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man\\r\\nought likewise to be, if he possibly can.  His character is thereby\\r\\ncomplete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\r\\ntime.  I did not expect such a compliment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not you? I did for you.  But that is one great difference\\r\\nbetween us.  Compliments always take YOU by surprise, and\\r\\nME never.  What could be more natural than his asking you\\r\\nagain?  He could not help seeing that you were about five times\\r\\nas pretty as every other woman in the room.  No thanks to his\\r\\ngallantry for that.  Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I\\r\\ngive you leave to like him.  You have liked many a stupider\\r\\nperson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\r\\ngeneral.  You never see a fault in anybody.  All the world are\\r\\ngood and agreeable in your eyes.  I never heard you speak ill of\\r\\na human being in your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\\r\\nspeak what I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you do; and it is THAT which makes the wonder.  With\\r\\nYOUR good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\r\\nnonsense of others!  Affectation of candour is common enough--\\r\\none meets with it everywhere.  But to be candid without\\r\\nostentation or design-- to take the good of everybody\\'s\\r\\ncharacter and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--\\r\\nbelongs to you alone.  And so you like this man\\'s sisters, too, do\\r\\nyou?  Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not-- at first.  But they are very pleasing women when\\r\\nyou converse with them.  Miss Bingley is to live with her\\r\\nbrother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall\\r\\nnot find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\r\\nbehaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\r\\ngeneral; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\r\\nof temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by\\r\\nany attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\r\\nthem.  They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\r\\nhumour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making\\r\\nthemselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\\r\\nconceited.  They were rather handsome, had been educated in\\r\\none of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of\\r\\ntwenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more\\r\\nthan they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and\\r\\nwere therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\\r\\nthemselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable\\r\\nfamily in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\\r\\nimpressed on their memories than that their brother\\'s fortune\\r\\nand their own had been acquired by trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a\\r\\nhundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to\\r\\npurchase an estate, but did not live to do it.  Mr. Bingley\\r\\nintended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county;\\r\\nbut as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of\\r\\na manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the\\r\\neasiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\r\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next\\r\\ngeneration to purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\\r\\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\r\\nwas by no means unwilling to preside at his table-- nor was Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\r\\ndisposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\r\\nMr. Bingley had not been or age two years, when he was tempted\\r\\nby an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.\\r\\nHe did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour-- was pleased with\\r\\nthe situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the\\r\\nowner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\r\\nspite of great opposition of character.  Bingley was endeared to\\r\\nDarcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\r\\nthough no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\r\\nand though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.  On the\\r\\nstrength of Darcy\\'s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\r\\nof his judgement the highest opinion.  In understanding, Darcy\\r\\nwas the superior.  Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy\\r\\nwas clever.  He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\r\\nfastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\\r\\nIn that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.  Bingley was\\r\\nsure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\r\\ngiving offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\r\\nsufficiently characteristic.  Bingley had never met with more\\r\\npleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\r\\nmost kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\r\\nstiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as\\r\\nto Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\r\\nDarcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\r\\nthere was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\r\\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention\\r\\nor pleasure.  Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she\\r\\nsmiled too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so-- but still they\\r\\nadmired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet\\r\\ngirl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\\r\\nMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their\\r\\nbrother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as\\r\\nhe chose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom\\r\\nthe Bennets were particularly intimate.  Sir William Lucas had\\r\\nbeen formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a\\r\\ntolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an\\r\\naddress to the king during his mayoralty.  The distinction had\\r\\nperhaps been felt too strongly.  It had given him a disgust to\\r\\nhis business, and to his residence in a small market town; and,\\r\\nin quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a\\r\\nhouse about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that\\r\\nperiod Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his\\r\\nown importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself\\r\\nsolely in being civil to all the world.  For, though elated by his\\r\\nrank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was\\r\\nall attention to everybody.  By nature inoffensive, friendly, and\\r\\nobliging, his presentation at St. James\\'s had made him\\r\\ncourteous.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to\\r\\nbe a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.  They had several\\r\\nchildren.  The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young\\r\\nwoman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to\\r\\ntalk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after\\r\\nthe assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\r\\ncommunicate. \"YOU began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.  \"YOU\\r\\nwere Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her\\r\\ntwice. To be sure that DID seem as if he admired her-- indeed I\\r\\nrather believe he DID-- I heard something about it-- but I\\r\\nhardly know what-- something about Mr. Robinson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.\\r\\nRobinson; did not I mention it to you?  Mr. Robinson\\'s asking\\r\\nhim how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did\\r\\nnot think there were a great many pretty women in the room,\\r\\nand WHICH he thought the prettiest? and his answering\\r\\nimmediately to the last question:  \\'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\\r\\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word!  Well, that is very decided indeed-- that does\\r\\nseem as if-- but, however, it may all come to nothing, you\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS,\\r\\nEliza,\" said Charlotte.  \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth\\r\\nlistening to as his friend, is he?-- poor Eliza!-- to be only just\\r\\nTOLERABLE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by\\r\\nhis ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it\\r\\nwould be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.  Mrs. Long\\r\\ntold me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour\\r\\nwithout once opening his lips.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you quite sure, ma\\'am?-- is not there a little mistake?\"\\r\\nsaid Jane.  \"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield,\\r\\nand he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed\\r\\nquite angry at being spoke to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much,\\r\\nunless among his intimate acquaintances.  With THEM he is\\r\\nremarkably agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been so very\\r\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.  But I can guess\\r\\nhow it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I\\r\\ndare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep\\r\\na carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas,\\r\\n\"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance\\r\\nwith HIM, if I were you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe, ma\\'am, I may safely promise you NEVER to dance\\r\\nwith him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend ME so much as\\r\\npride often does, because there is an excuse for it.  One cannot\\r\\nwonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\r\\neverything in his favour, should think highly of himself.  If I\\r\\nmay so express it, he has a RIGHT to be proud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily\\r\\nforgive HIS pride, if he had not mortified MINE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity\\r\\nof her reflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe. By all\\r\\nthat I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\r\\nindeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\r\\nthere are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\r\\nself-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\r\\nimaginary.  Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\r\\nwords are often used synonymously.  A person may be proud\\r\\nwithout being vain.  Pride relates more to our opinion of\\r\\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who\\r\\ncame with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was.  I\\r\\nwould keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a\\r\\nday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\r\\nyour bottle directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\r\\nthat she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.\\r\\nThe visit was soon returned in due form.  Miss Bennet\\'s\\r\\npleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\r\\nBingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable,\\r\\nand the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of\\r\\nbeing better acquainted with THEM was expressed towards\\r\\nthe two eldest.  By Jane, this attention was received with the\\r\\ngreatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in\\r\\ntheir treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister,\\r\\nand could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it\\r\\nwas, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence\\r\\nof their brother\\'s admiration.  It was generally evident\\r\\nwhenever they met, that he DID admire her and to HER it was\\r\\nequally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which\\r\\nshe had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\r\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure\\r\\nthat it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general,\\r\\nsince Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure\\r\\nof temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would\\r\\nguard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.  She\\r\\nmentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to\\r\\nimpose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\r\\ndisadvantage to be so very guarded.  If a woman conceals her\\r\\naffection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\r\\nthe opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\r\\nconsolation to believe the world equally in the dark.  There is\\r\\nso much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that\\r\\nit is not safe to leave any to itself.  We can all BEGIN freely-- a\\r\\nslight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\r\\nwho have heart enough to be really in love without\\r\\nencouragement.  In nine cases out of ten a women had better\\r\\nshow MORE affection than she feels.  Bingley, likes your\\r\\nsister, undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if\\r\\nshe does not help him on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.  If\\r\\nI can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton,\\r\\nindeed, not to discover it too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as\\r\\nyou do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\r\\nconceal it, he must find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.  But, though\\r\\nBingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many\\r\\nhours together; and, as they always see each other in large\\r\\nmixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be\\r\\nemployed in conversing together.  Jane should therefore make\\r\\nthe most of every half-hour in which she can command his\\r\\nattention.  When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure\\r\\nfor falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is\\r\\nin question but the desire of being well married, and if I were\\r\\ndetermined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\r\\nshould adopt it.  But these are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not\\r\\nacting by design.  As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\r\\ndegree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness.  She has\\r\\nknown him only a fortnight.  She danced four dances with him\\r\\nat Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and\\r\\nhas since dined with him in company four times. This is not\\r\\nquite enough to make her understand his character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him, she\\r\\nmight only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\r\\nyou must remember that four evenings have also been spent\\r\\ntogether-- and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\r\\nthey both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect\\r\\nto any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much\\r\\nhas been unfolded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\r\\nand if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she\\r\\nhad as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying\\r\\nhis character for a twelvemonth.  Happiness in marriage is\\r\\nentirely  a matter of chance.  If the dispositions of the parties are\\r\\never so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand,\\r\\nit does not advance their felicity in the least.  They always\\r\\ncontinue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their\\r\\nshare of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of\\r\\nthe defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.  You know\\r\\nit is not sound, and that you would never act in this way\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\\'s attentions to her sister,\\r\\nElizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\r\\nan object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\r\\nher without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\r\\nlooked at her only to criticise.  But no sooner had he made it\\r\\nclear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature\\r\\nin her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly\\r\\nintelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.  To this\\r\\ndiscovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.  Though he\\r\\nhad detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect\\r\\nsymmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure\\r\\nto be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her\\r\\nmanners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught\\r\\nby their easy playfulness.  Of this she was perfectly unaware; to\\r\\nher he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere,\\r\\nand who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\r\\nconversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\r\\nothers.  His doing so drew her notice.  It was at Sir William\\r\\nLucas\\'s, where a large party were assembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by\\r\\nlistening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\r\\nsee what he is about.  He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not\\r\\nbegin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without\\r\\nseeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied\\r\\nher friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately\\r\\nprovoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself\\r\\nuncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster\\r\\nto give us a ball at Meryton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\r\\nenergetic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be HER turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas.  \"I\\r\\nam going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what\\r\\nfollows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!-- always\\r\\nwanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!  If\\r\\nmy vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been\\r\\ninvaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before\\r\\nthose who must be in the habit of hearing the very best\\r\\nperformers.\"  On Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however, she added,\\r\\n\"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\"  And gravely glancing at Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\\r\\ncourse familiar with:  \\'Keep your breath to cool your porridge\\';\\r\\nand I shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.\\r\\nAfter a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties\\r\\nof several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded\\r\\nat the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence\\r\\nof being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for\\r\\nknowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for\\r\\ndisplay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\r\\nher application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\r\\nconceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\r\\nexcellence than she had reached.  Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\r\\nhad been listened to with much more pleasure, though not\\r\\nplaying half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto,\\r\\nwas glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish\\r\\nairs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the\\r\\nLucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at\\r\\none end of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode\\r\\nof passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\r\\nwas too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir\\r\\nWilliam Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as\\r\\none of the first refinements of polished society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\r\\namongst the less polished societies of the world.  Every savage\\r\\ncan dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William only smiled.  \"Your friend performs delightfully,\" he\\r\\ncontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \"and I\\r\\ndoubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\\r\\nsight.  Do you often dance at St. James\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the\\r\\nplace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself-- for I am\\r\\nfond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the\\r\\nair of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\\r\\ndisposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\\r\\ntowards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very\\r\\ngallant thing, and called out to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?  Mr. Darcy, you\\r\\nmust allow me to present this young lady to you as a very\\r\\ndesirable partner.  You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when\\r\\nso much beauty is before you.\"  And, taking her hand, he would\\r\\nhave given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised,\\r\\nwas not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back,\\r\\nand said with some discomposure to Sir William:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.  I entreat\\r\\nyou not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a\\r\\npartner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\\r\\nhonour of her hand, but in vain.  Elizabeth was determined; nor\\r\\ndid Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\\r\\npersuasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\\r\\ndeny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\\r\\ndislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I\\r\\nam sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\\r\\nEliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance-- for who would\\r\\nobject to such a partner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away.  Her resistance had\\r\\nnot injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her\\r\\nwith some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass\\r\\nmany evenings in this manner-- in such society; and indeed I am\\r\\nquite of you opinion.  I was never more annoyed!  The insipidity,\\r\\nand yet the noise-- the nothingness, and yet the self-importance\\r\\nof all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on\\r\\nthem!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.  My mind was\\r\\nmore agreeably engaged.  I have been meditating on the very\\r\\ngreat pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty\\r\\nwoman can bestow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, a desired he\\r\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\\r\\nreflections.  Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley.  \"I am all\\r\\nastonishment.  How long has she been such a favourite?-- and\\r\\npray, when am I to wish you joy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.  A\\r\\nlady\\'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\\r\\nlove, from love to matrimony, in a moment.  I knew you would\\r\\nbe wishing me joy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is\\r\\nabsolutely settled.  You will be having a charming\\r\\nmother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at\\r\\nPemberley with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to\\r\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\\r\\nher that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\\r\\ntwo thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\\r\\nentailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their\\r\\nmother\\'s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could\\r\\nbut ill supply the deficiency of his.  Her father had been an\\r\\nattorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\\r\\nto their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\\r\\nsettled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a\\r\\nmost convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\\r\\ntempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\\r\\ntheir aunt and to a milliner\\'s shop just over the way.  The two\\r\\nyoungest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\\r\\nfrequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\\r\\ntheir sisters\\', and when nothing better offered, a walk to\\r\\nMeryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and\\r\\nfurnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\\r\\nthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\\r\\nsome from their aunt.  At present, indeed, they were well\\r\\nsupplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of\\r\\na militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the\\r\\nwhole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most\\r\\ninteresting intelligence.  Every day added something to their\\r\\nknowledge of the officers\\' names and connections.  Their\\r\\nlodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to\\r\\nknow the officers themselves.  Mr. Phillips visited them all, and\\r\\nthis opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before.\\r\\nThey could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\\'s large\\r\\nfortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother,\\r\\nwas worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\\r\\nan ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\r\\nBennet coolly observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\\r\\nbe two of the silliest girls in the country.  I have suspected it\\r\\nsome time, but I am now convinced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia,\\r\\nwith perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\\r\\nCaptain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\\r\\nday, as he was going the next morning to London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should\\r\\nbe so ready to think your own children silly.  If I wished to think\\r\\nslightingly of anybody\\'s children, it should not be of my own,\\r\\nhowever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\\r\\nagree.  I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\\r\\nparticular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\\r\\nyoungest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have\\r\\nthe sense of their father and mother.  When they get to our age, I\\r\\ndare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\\r\\nI remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--\\r\\nand, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young\\r\\ncolonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my\\r\\ngirls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster\\r\\nlooked very becoming the other night at Sir William\\'s in his\\r\\nregimentals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\\r\\nCaptain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\'s as they did\\r\\nwhen they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\\r\\nClarke\\'s library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the\\r\\nfootman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield,\\r\\nand the servant waited for an answer.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes\\r\\nsparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while\\r\\nher daughter read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from?  What is it about?  What does he\\r\\nsay?  Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,--\\r\\n     \"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with\\r\\nLouisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for\\r\\nthe rest of our lives, for a whole day\\'s tete-a-tete between two\\r\\nwomen can never end without a quarrel.  Come as soon as you\\r\\ncan on receipt of this.  My brother and the gentlemen are to dine\\r\\nwith the officers.-- Yours ever,\\r\\n                                             \"CAROLINE BINGLEY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia.  \"I wonder my aunt did not tell\\r\\nus of THAT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\\r\\nlikely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were\\r\\nsure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\\'s chaise to go to\\r\\nMeryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\\r\\nThey are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother\\'s\\r\\npurpose will be answered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that\\r\\nthe horses were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on\\r\\nhorseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\\r\\ncheerful prognostics of a bad day.  Her hopes were answered;\\r\\nJane had not been gone long before it rained hard.  Her sisters\\r\\nwere uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.  The rain\\r\\ncontinued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly\\r\\ncould not some back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet more\\r\\nthan once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.  Till\\r\\nthe next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity\\r\\nof her contrivance.  Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant\\r\\nfrom Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--\\r\\n     \"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I\\r\\nsuppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.\\r\\nMy kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.\\r\\nThey insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones-- therefore do not be\\r\\nalarmed if you should hear of his having been to me-- and,\\r\\nexcepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\\r\\nmatter with me.-- Yours, etc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\\r\\nnote aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\\r\\nillness-- if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\\r\\nwas all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying.  People do not die of little\\r\\ntrifling colds.  She will be taken good care of.  As long as she\\r\\nstays there, it is all very well.  I would go an see her if I could\\r\\nhave the carriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\\r\\nthough the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\\r\\nhorsewoman, walking was her only alternative.  She declared her\\r\\nresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such\\r\\na thing, in all this dirt!  You will not be fit to be seen when you\\r\\nget there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane-- which is all I want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the horses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\\r\\nnothing when one has a motive; only three miles.  I shall be back\\r\\nby dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but\\r\\nevery impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\\r\\nopinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\\r\\nrequired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and\\r\\nLydia.  Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\\r\\nladies set off together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps\\r\\nwe may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the\\r\\nlodgings of one of the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued\\r\\nher walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping\\r\\nover stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity,\\r\\nand finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\\r\\nankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\\r\\nexercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane\\r\\nwere assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal\\r\\nof surprise.  That she should have walked three miles so early in\\r\\nthe day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost\\r\\nincredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nconvinced that they held her in contempt for it.  She was\\r\\nreceived, however, very politely by them; and in their brother\\'s\\r\\nmanners there was something better than politeness; there was\\r\\ngood humour and kindness.  Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\\r\\nHurst nothing at all.  The former was divided between\\r\\nadmiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her\\r\\ncomplexion, and doubt as to the occasion\\'s justifying her coming\\r\\nso far alone.  The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\r\\nMiss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\\r\\nnot well enough to leave her room.  Elizabeth was glad to be\\r\\ntaken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld\\r\\nby the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in\\r\\nher note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at\\r\\nher entrance.  She was not equal, however, to much\\r\\nconversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could\\r\\nattempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\\r\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with.  Elizabeth silently\\r\\nattended her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and\\r\\nElizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\\r\\naffection and solicitude they showed for Jane.  The apothecary\\r\\ncame, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\\r\\nsupposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\\r\\nendeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\\r\\nand promised her some draughts.  The advice was followed\\r\\nreadily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached\\r\\nacutely.  Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\\r\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had,\\r\\nin fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\\r\\nvery unwillingly said so.  Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\\r\\nand she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\\r\\ntestified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\\r\\nobliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\\r\\nremain at Netherfield for the present.  Elizabeth most thankfully\\r\\nconsented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to\\r\\nacquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of\\r\\nclothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt five o\\'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\\r\\nsix Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.  To the civil inquiries\\r\\nwhich then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure\\r\\nof distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nshe could not make a very favourable answer.  Jane was by no\\r\\nmeans better.  The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\\r\\ntimes how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have\\r\\na bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill\\r\\nthemselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\r\\nindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them\\r\\nrestored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\\r\\ncould regard with any complacency.  His anxiety for Jane was\\r\\nevident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\\r\\nprevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she\\r\\nbelieved she was considered by the others. She had very little\\r\\nnotice from any but him.  Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom\\r\\nElizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat,\\r\\ndrink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a\\r\\nplain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\\r\\nBingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.\\r\\nHer manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture\\r\\nof pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no\\r\\nbeauty.  Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\\r\\nexcellent walker.  I shall never forget her appearance this\\r\\nmorning.  She really looked almost wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa.  I could hardly keep my countenance.\\r\\nVery nonsensical to come at all!  Why must SHE be scampering\\r\\nabout the country, because her sister had a cold?  Her hair, so\\r\\nuntidy, so blowsy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\\r\\ndeep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had\\r\\nbeen let down to hide it not doing its office.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but\\r\\nthis was all lost upon me.  I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\r\\nlooked remarkably well when she came into the room this\\r\\nmorning.  Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley;\\r\\n\"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see\\r\\nYOUR sister make such an exhibition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it\\r\\nis, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!  What could\\r\\nshe mean by it?  It seems to me to show an abominable sort of\\r\\nconceited independence, a most country-town indifference to\\r\\ndecorum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\\r\\nBingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half\\r\\nwhisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your\\r\\nadmiration of her fine eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"\\r\\nA short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a\\r\\nvery sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well\\r\\nsettled.  But with such a father and mother, and such low\\r\\nconnections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on\\r\\nMeryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near\\r\\nCheapside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed\\r\\nheartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside,\" cried\\r\\nBingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men\\r\\nof any consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it\\r\\ntheir hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the\\r\\nexpense of their dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her\\r\\nroom on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till\\r\\nsummoned to coffee.  She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth\\r\\nwould not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had\\r\\nthe comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather\\r\\nright than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.  On\\r\\nentering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and\\r\\nwas immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\r\\nplaying high, she declined it, for the short time she could stay\\r\\nbelow, with a book.  Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather\\r\\nsingular.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a\\r\\ngreat reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"I am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\"said\\r\\nBingley; \"and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite\\r\\nwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards\\r\\nthe table where a few books were lying.  He immediately offered\\r\\nto fetch her others-- all that his library afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my\\r\\nown credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many,\\r\\nI have more than I ever looked into.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\\r\\nthose in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should\\r\\nhave left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library\\r\\nyou have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\r\\ngenerations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are\\r\\nalways buying books.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\\r\\nas these.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neglect!  I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\\r\\nbeauties of that noble place.  Charles, when you build YOUR\\r\\nhouse, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\r\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.  There\\r\\nis not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\r\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her\\r\\nvery little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside,\\r\\nshe drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.\\r\\nBingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think she will.  She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s\\r\\nheight, or rather taller.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who\\r\\ndelighted me so much.  Such a countenance, such manners!  And\\r\\nso extremely accomplished for her age!  Her performance on the\\r\\npianoforte is exquisite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have\\r\\npatience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you\\r\\nmean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think.  They all paint tables, cover screens,\\r\\nand net purses.  I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this,\\r\\nand I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first\\r\\ntime, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a\\r\\nwoman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or\\r\\ncovering a screen.  But I am very far from agreeing with you in\\r\\nyour estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing\\r\\nmore than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance,\\r\\nthat are really accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal\\r\\nin your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\r\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is\\r\\nusually met with.  A woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\r\\nmusic, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to\\r\\ndeserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain\\r\\nsomething in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her\\r\\nvoice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but\\r\\nhalf-deserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she\\r\\nmust yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of\\r\\nher mind by extensive reading.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six\\r\\naccomplished women.  I rather wonder now at your knowing\\r\\nANY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the\\r\\npossibility of all this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw such a woman.  I never saw such capacity, and\\r\\ntaste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\\r\\nof her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew\\r\\nmany women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst\\r\\ncalled them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention\\r\\nto what was going forward.  As all conversation was thereby at\\r\\nan end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was\\r\\nclosed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to\\r\\nrecommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their\\r\\nown; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.  But, in my\\r\\nopinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly\\r\\naddressed, \"there is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies\\r\\nsometimes condescend to employ for captivation.  Whatever\\r\\nbears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\r\\ncontinue the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\\r\\nworse, and that she could not leave her.  Bingley urged Mr.\\r\\nJones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced\\r\\nthat no country advice could be of any service, recommended an\\r\\nexpress to town for one of the most eminent physicians.  This\\r\\nshe would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply\\r\\nwith their brother\\'s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones\\r\\nshould be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not\\r\\ndecidedly better.  Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\r\\ndeclared that they were miserable:  They solaced their\\r\\nwretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could\\r\\nfind no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper\\r\\ndirections that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and\\r\\nher sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\'s room, and\\r\\nin the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable\\r\\nanswer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr.\\r\\nBingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two\\r\\nelegant ladies who waited on his sisters.  In spite of this\\r\\namendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to\\r\\nLongbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\r\\njudgement of her situation.  The note was immediately\\r\\ndispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached\\r\\nNetherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would\\r\\nhave been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that\\r\\nher illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering\\r\\nimmediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove\\r\\nher from Netherfield.  She would not listen, therefore, to her\\r\\ndaughter\\'s proposal of being carried home; neither did the\\r\\napothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all\\r\\nadvisable.  After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\r\\nBingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three\\r\\ndaughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.  Bingley met\\r\\nthem with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet\\r\\nworse than she expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill\\r\\nto be moved.  Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\\r\\nWe must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley.  \"It must not be thought of.  My\\r\\nsister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon it, madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold\\r\\ncivility, \"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention\\r\\nwhile she remains with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do\\r\\nnot know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,\\r\\nand suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the\\r\\nworld, which is always the way with her, for she has, without\\r\\nexception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.  I often tell\\r\\nmy other girls they are nothing to HER. You have a sweet room\\r\\nhere, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel\\r\\nwalk.  I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\r\\nNetherfield.  You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope,\\r\\nthough you have but a short lease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\\r\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in\\r\\nfive minutes.  At present, however, I consider myself as quite\\r\\nfixed here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning\\r\\ntowards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- I understand you perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily\\r\\nseen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is as it happens.  It does not follow that a deep, intricate\\r\\ncharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not\\r\\nrun on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that\\r\\nyour were a studier of character.  It must be an amusing study.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing.  They\\r\\nhave at least that advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few\\r\\nsubjects for such a study.  In a country neighbourhood you move\\r\\nin a very confined and unvarying society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something\\r\\nnew to be observed in them for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of\\r\\nmentioning a country neighbourhood.  \"I assure you there is\\r\\nquite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a\\r\\nmoment, turned silently away.  Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she\\r\\nhad gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\\r\\ncountry, for my part, except the shops and public places.  The\\r\\ncountry is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\\r\\nand when I am in town it is pretty much the same.  They have\\r\\neach their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- that is because you have the right disposition.  But that\\r\\ngentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was\\r\\nnothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for\\r\\nher mother.  \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.  He only meant that\\r\\nthere was not such a variety of people to be met with in the\\r\\ncountry as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be\\r\\ntrue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\\r\\nmeeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there\\r\\nare few neighbourhoods larger.  I know we dine with\\r\\nfour-and-twenty families.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep\\r\\nhis countenance.  His sister was less delicate, and directed her\\r\\neyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nfor the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\\'s\\r\\nthoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at\\r\\nLongbourn since HER coming away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.  What an agreeable\\r\\nman Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he?  So much the man of\\r\\nfashion!  So genteel and easy!  He had always something to say\\r\\nto everybody.  THAT is my idea of good breeding; and those\\r\\npersons who fancy themselves very important, and never open\\r\\ntheir mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, she would go home.  I fancy she was wanted about\\r\\nmince-pies.  For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants\\r\\nthat can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up very\\r\\ndifferently.  But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the\\r\\nLucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you.  It is a pity\\r\\nthey are not handsome!  Not that I think Charlotte so VERY\\r\\nplain-- but then she is our particular friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nherself has often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty.  I do not\\r\\nlike to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane-- one does\\r\\nnot often see anybody better looking.  It is what everybody says.\\r\\nI do not trust my own partiality.  When she was only fifteen,\\r\\nthere was a man at my brother Gardiner\\'s in town so much in\\r\\nlove with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her\\r\\nan offer before we came away.  But, however, he did not.\\r\\nPerhaps he thought her too young.  However, he wrote some\\r\\nverses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently.  \"There\\r\\nhas been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.  I\\r\\nwonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving\\r\\naway love!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love,\" said\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of  a fine, stout, healthy love it may.  Everything nourishes\\r\\nwhat is strong already.  But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\\r\\ninclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\\r\\nentirely away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\\r\\nElizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself\\r\\nagain.  She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;\\r\\nand after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\\r\\ntroubling him also with Lizzy.  Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly\\r\\ncivil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,\\r\\nand say what the occasion required.  She performed her part\\r\\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was\\r\\nsatisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.  Upon this\\r\\nsignal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.  The\\r\\ntwo girls had been whispering to each other during the whole\\r\\nvisit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.\\r\\nBingley with having promised on his first coming into the\\r\\ncountry to give a ball at Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\\r\\ncomplexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with\\r\\nher mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an\\r\\nearly age.  She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural\\r\\nself-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom\\r\\nher uncle\\'s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended\\r\\nher, had increased into assurance.  She was very equal,\\r\\ntherefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\\r\\nabruptly reminded him that it would be the most shameful thing\\r\\nin the world if he did not keep it.  His answer to this sudden\\r\\nattack was delightful to her mother\\'s ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\\r\\nwhen your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the\\r\\nvery day of the ball.  But you would not wish to be dancing\\r\\nwhen she is ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia declared herself satisfied.  \"Oh! yes-- it would be much\\r\\nbetter to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely\\r\\nCaptain Carter would be at Meryton again.  And when you have\\r\\ngiven YOUR ball,\" she added, \"I shall insist on their giving one\\r\\nalso.  I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he\\r\\ndoes not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughter then departed, and Elizabeth\\r\\nreturned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\'\\r\\nbehaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the\\r\\nlatter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in\\r\\ntheir censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on\\r\\nFINE EYES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done.  Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the\\r\\ninvalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the\\r\\nevening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.  The\\r\\nloo-table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and\\r\\nMiss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his\\r\\nletter and repeatedly calling his attention by messages to his\\r\\nsister.  Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst was observing their game.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently\\r\\namused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his\\r\\ncompanion.  The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on\\r\\nhis handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length\\r\\nof his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises\\r\\nwere received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in\\r\\nunion with her opinion of each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken.  I write rather slowly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the\\r\\ncourse of a year!  Letters of business, too!  How odious I should\\r\\nthink them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen.  Let me mend it for you.  I\\r\\nmend pens remarkably well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you-- but I always mend my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on\\r\\nthe harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with\\r\\nher beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely\\r\\nsuperior to Miss Grantley\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?\\r\\nAt present I have not room to do them justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  It is of no consequence.  I shall see her in January.  But do\\r\\nyou always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not\\r\\nfor me to determine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter\\r\\nwith ease, cannot write ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried\\r\\nher brother, \"because he does not write with ease.  He studies\\r\\ntoo much for words of four syllables.  Do not you, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless\\r\\nway imaginable.  He leaves out half his words, and blots the\\r\\nrest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--\\r\\nby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to\\r\\nmy correspondents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm\\r\\nreproof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\\r\\nhumility.  It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes\\r\\nan indirect boast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of\\r\\nmodesty?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\r\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a\\r\\nrapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not\\r\\nestimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The power of\\r\\ndoing anything with quickness is always prized much by the\\r\\npossessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\\r\\nthe performance.  When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning, that\\r\\nif you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be\\r\\ngone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of\\r\\ncompliment to yourself-- and yet what is there so very laudable\\r\\nin a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\r\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone\\r\\nelse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all\\r\\nthe foolish things that were said in the morning.  And, yet, upon\\r\\nmy honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I\\r\\nbelieve it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume\\r\\nthe character of needless precipitance merely to show off before\\r\\nthe ladies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\r\\nyou would be gone with such celerity.  Your conduct would be\\r\\nquite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if,\\r\\nas you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,  \\'Bingley,\\r\\nyou had better stay till next week,\\' you would probably do it,\\r\\nyou would probably not go-- and at another word, might stay a\\r\\nmonth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr.\\r\\nBingley did not do justice to his own disposition.  You have\\r\\nshown him off now much more than he did himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting\\r\\nwhat my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my\\r\\ntemper.  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that\\r\\ngentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think\\r\\nbetter of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat\\r\\ndenial, and ride off as fast as I could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original\\r\\nintentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must\\r\\nspeak for himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to\\r\\ncall mine, but which I have never acknowledged.  Allowing the\\r\\ncase, however, to stand according to your representation, you\\r\\nmust remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to\\r\\ndesire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has\\r\\nmerely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in\\r\\nfavour of its propriety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield readily-- easily-- to the PERSUASION of a friend is\\r\\nno merit with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the\\r\\nunderstanding of either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the\\r\\ninfluence of friendship and affection.  A regard for the requester\\r\\nwould often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting\\r\\nfor arguments to reason one into it.  I am not particularly\\r\\nspeaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance\\r\\noccurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\r\\nthereupon.  But in general and ordinary cases between friend and\\r\\nfriend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a\\r\\nresolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that\\r\\nperson for complying with the desire, without waiting to be\\r\\nargued into it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\r\\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance\\r\\nwhich is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of\\r\\nintimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\\r\\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have\\r\\nmore weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be\\r\\naware of.  I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall\\r\\nfellow, in comparison with myself, that I should not pay him half\\r\\nso much deference.  I declare I do not know a more awful object\\r\\nthan Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at\\r\\nhis own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has\\r\\nnothing to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that\\r\\nhe was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.  Miss\\r\\nBingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an\\r\\nexpostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.  \"You dislike an\\r\\nargument, and want to silence this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I do.  Arguments are too much like disputes.  If you\\r\\nand Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall\\r\\nbe very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and\\r\\nElizabeth for an indulgence of some music.  Miss Bingley moved\\r\\nwith some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request\\r\\nthat Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely\\r\\nand more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\\r\\nemployed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned\\r\\nover some music-books that lay on the instrument, how\\r\\nfrequently Mr. Darcy\\'s eyes were fixed on her.  She hardly knew\\r\\nhow to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so\\r\\ngreat a man; and yet that he should look at her because he\\r\\ndisliked her, was still more strange.  She could only imagine,\\r\\nhowever, at last that she drew his notice because there was\\r\\nsomething more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas\\r\\nof right, than in any other person present.  The supposition did\\r\\nnot pain her.  She liked him too little to care for his approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\\r\\nby a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing\\r\\nnear Elizabeth, said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such\\r\\nan opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled, but made no answer.  He repeated the question, with\\r\\nsome surprise at her silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately\\r\\ndetermine what to say in reply.  You wanted me, I know, to say\\r\\n\\'Yes,\\' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;\\r\\nbut I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and\\r\\ncheating a person of their meditated contempt.  I have,\\r\\ntherefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to\\r\\ndance a reel at all-- and now despise me if you dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at\\r\\nhis gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness\\r\\nin her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;\\r\\nand Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he\\r\\nwas by her.  He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority\\r\\nof her connections, he should be in some danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her\\r\\ngreat anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received\\r\\nsome assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by\\r\\ntalking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in\\r\\nsuch an alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the\\r\\nshrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few\\r\\nhints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage\\r\\nof holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the\\r\\nyounger girls of running after officers.  And, if I may mention so\\r\\ndelicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,\\r\\nbordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady\\r\\npossesses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes.  Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips get\\r\\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them next to your\\r\\ngreat-uncle the judge.  They are in the same profession, you\\r\\nknow, only in different lines.  As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you\\r\\nmust not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those\\r\\nbeautiful eyes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\\r\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might\\r\\nbe copied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Elizabeth herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley,\\r\\nin some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You used us abominably ill, \"answered Mrs. Hurst, \"running\\r\\naway without telling us that you were coming out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\\r\\nto walk by herself.  The path just admitted three.  Mr. Darcy felt\\r\\ntheir rudeness, and immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had better go\\r\\ninto the avenue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\\r\\nthem, laughingly answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; stay where you are.  You are charmingly grouped, and\\r\\nappear to uncommon advantage.  The picturesque would be\\r\\nspoilt by admitting a fourth.  Good-bye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the\\r\\nhope of being at home again in a day or two.  Jane was already\\r\\nso much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of\\r\\nhours that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\r\\nsister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into\\r\\nthe drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends\\r\\nwith many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen\\r\\nthem so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed\\r\\nbefore the gentlemen appeared.  Their powers of conversation\\r\\nwere considerable.  They could describe an entertainment with\\r\\naccuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\\r\\nacquaintance with spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first\\r\\nobject; Miss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,\\r\\nand she had something to say to him before he had advanced\\r\\nmany steps.  He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite\\r\\ncongratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said\\r\\nhe was \"very glad\"; but diffuseness and warmth remained for\\r\\nBingley\\'s salutation.  He was full of joy and attention.  The first\\r\\nhalf-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer\\r\\nfrom the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the\\r\\nother side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the\\r\\ndoor.  He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\r\\nelse.  Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with\\r\\ngreat delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\r\\ncard-table-- but in vain.  She had obtained private intelligence\\r\\nthat Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found\\r\\neven his open petition rejected.  She assured him that no one\\r\\nintended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the\\r\\nsubject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to\\r\\ndo, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\r\\nDarcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\\r\\nrings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with\\r\\nMiss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s progress through HIS book, as in reading her own;\\r\\nand she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking\\r\\nat his page.  She could not win him, however, to any\\r\\nconversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.  At\\r\\nlength, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her\\r\\nown book, which she had only chosen because it was the second\\r\\nvolume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it\\r\\nis to spend an evening in this way!  I declare after all there is no\\r\\nenjoyment like reading!  How much sooner one tires of anything\\r\\nthan of a book!  When I have a house of my own, I shall be\\r\\nmiserable if I have not an excellent library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one made any reply.  She then yawned again, threw aside her\\r\\nbook, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some\\r\\namusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss\\r\\nBennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance\\r\\nat Netherfield?  I would advise you, before you determine on it,\\r\\nto consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if\\r\\nthere are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a\\r\\npunishment than a pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\\r\\nchooses, before it begins-- but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\r\\nthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I\\r\\nshall send round my cards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\\r\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something\\r\\ninsufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.  It\\r\\nwould surely be much more rational if conversation instead of\\r\\ndancing were made the order of the day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would\\r\\nnot be near so much like a ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up\\r\\nand walked about the room.  Her figure was elegant, and she\\r\\nwalked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still\\r\\ninflexibly studious.  In the desperation of her feelings, she\\r\\nresolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example,\\r\\nand take a turn about the room.  I assure you it is very refreshing\\r\\nafter sitting so long in one attitude.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.  Miss\\r\\nBingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\r\\nDarcy looked up.  He was as much awake to the novelty of\\r\\nattention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and\\r\\nunconsciously closed his book.  He was directly invited to join\\r\\ntheir party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine\\r\\nbut two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the\\r\\nroom together, with either of which motives his joining them\\r\\nwould interfere.  \"What could he mean?  She was dying to know\\r\\nwhat could be his meaning?\"-- and asked Elizabeth whether she\\r\\ncould at all understand him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to\\r\\nbe severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be\\r\\nto ask nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.\\r\\nDarcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an\\r\\nexplanation of his two motives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he,\\r\\nas soon as she allowed him to speak.  \"You either choose this\\r\\nmethod of passing the evening because you are in each other\\'s\\r\\nconfidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are\\r\\nconscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in\\r\\nwalking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if\\r\\nthe second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley.  \"I never heard anything so\\r\\nabominable.  How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\"We can all plague and punish one another.  Tease him-- laugh\\r\\nat him.  Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be\\r\\ndone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But upon my honour, I do NOT.  I do assure you that my\\r\\nintimacy has not yet taught me THAT.  Tease calmness of\\r\\nmanner and presence of mind!  No, no-- feel he may defy us\\r\\nthere.  And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you\\r\\nplease, by attempting to laugh without a subject.  Mr. Darcy may\\r\\nhug himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"That is an\\r\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue,\\r\\nfor it would be a great loss to ME to have many such\\r\\nacquaintances.  I dearly love a laugh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\\r\\nThe wisest and the best of men-- nay, the wisest and best of their\\r\\nactions-- may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first\\r\\nobject in life is a joke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth-- \"there are such people, but I\\r\\nhope I am not one of THEM.  I hope I never ridicule what is\\r\\nwise and good.  Follies and nonsense, whims and\\r\\ninconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them\\r\\nwhenever I can.  But these, I suppose, are precisely what you\\r\\nare without.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.  But it has been the\\r\\nstudy of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a\\r\\nstrong understanding to ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.  But pride-- where there is a\\r\\nreal superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\\r\\nregulation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"and pray what is the result?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.\\r\\nHe owns it himself without disguise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension.  I have\\r\\nfaults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.  My\\r\\ntemper I dare not vouch for.  It is, I believe, too little yielding--\\r\\ncertainly too little for the convenience of the world.  I cannot\\r\\nforget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their\\r\\noffenses against myself.  My feelings are not puffed about with\\r\\nevery attempt to move them.  My temper would perhaps be\\r\\ncalled resentful.  My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable\\r\\nresentment IS a shade in a character.  But you have chosen your\\r\\nfault well.  I really cannot LAUGH at it.  You are safe from me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some\\r\\nparticular evil-- a natural defect, which not even the best\\r\\neducation can overcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And YOUR defect is to hate everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yours, \"he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to\\r\\nmisunderstand them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\r\\nconversation in which she had no share.  \"Louisa, you will not\\r\\nmind my waking Mr. Hurst?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\r\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments\\' recollection, was not\\r\\nsorry for it.  He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too\\r\\nmuch attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth\\r\\nwrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage\\r\\nmight be sent for them in the course of the day.  But Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at\\r\\nNetherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly\\r\\nfinish Jane\\'s week, could not bring herself to receive them with\\r\\npleasure before.  Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\r\\nleast not to Elizabeth\\'s wishes, for she was impatient to get\\r\\nhome.  Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly\\r\\nhave the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was\\r\\nadded, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay\\r\\nlonger, she could spare them very well.  Against staying longer,\\r\\nhowever, Elizabeth was positively resolved-- nor did she much\\r\\nexpect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being\\r\\nconsidered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged\\r\\nJane to borrow Mr. Bingley\\'s carriage immediately, and at\\r\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving\\r\\nNetherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and\\r\\nenough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the\\r\\nfollowing day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going\\r\\nwas deferred.  Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had\\r\\nproposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister\\r\\nmuch exceeded her affection for the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were\\r\\nto go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that\\r\\nit would not be safe for her-- that she was not enough recovered;\\r\\nbut Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence-- Elizabeth had been\\r\\nat Netherfield long enough.  She attracted him more than he\\r\\nliked-- and Miss Bingley was uncivil to HER, and more teasing\\r\\nthan usual to himself.  He wisely resolved to be particularly\\r\\ncareful that no sign of admiration should NOW escape him,\\r\\nnothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his\\r\\nfelicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his\\r\\nbehaviour during the last day must have material weight in\\r\\nconfirming or crushing it.  Steady to his purpose, he scarcely\\r\\nspoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and\\r\\nthough they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour,\\r\\nhe adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not\\r\\neven look at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable\\r\\nto almost all, took place.  Miss Bingley\\'s civility to Elizabeth\\r\\nincreased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane;\\r\\nand when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it\\r\\nwould always give her to see her either at Longbourn or\\r\\nNetherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook\\r\\nhands with the former.  Elizabeth took leave of the whole party\\r\\nin the liveliest of spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very\\r\\nwrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have\\r\\ncaught cold again.  But their father, though very laconic in his\\r\\nexpressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt\\r\\ntheir importance in the family circle.  The evening conversation,\\r\\nwhen they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation,\\r\\nand almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass\\r\\nand human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some\\r\\nnew observations of threadbare morality to listen to.  Catherine\\r\\nand Lydia had information for them of a different sort.  Much\\r\\nhad been done and much had been said in the regiment since the\\r\\npreceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately\\r\\nwith their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually\\r\\nbeen hinted that colonel Foster was going to be married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\r\\nbreakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good\\r\\ndinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our\\r\\nfamily party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear?  I know of nobody that is coming,\\r\\nI am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in-- And\\r\\nI hope MY dinners are good enough for her.  I do not believe\\r\\nshe often sees such at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled.  \"A gentleman and a stranger!  It is\\r\\nMr. Bingley, I am sure!  Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad\\r\\nto see Mr. Bingley.  But--good Lord! how unlucky!  There is not\\r\\na bit of fish to be got to-day.  Lydia, my love, ring the bell-- I\\r\\nmust speak to Hill this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is NOT Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person whom\\r\\nI never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of\\r\\nbeing eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\r\\nexplained:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight\\r\\nago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and\\r\\nrequiring early attention.  It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\\r\\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\\r\\npleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that\\r\\nmentioned.  Pray do not talk of that odious man.  I do think it is\\r\\nthe hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed\\r\\naway from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I\\r\\nshould have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\r\\nThey had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on\\r\\nwhich Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she\\r\\ncontinued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling and estate\\r\\naway from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom\\r\\nnobody cared anything about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\\r\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting\\r\\nLongbourn.  But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps\\r\\nbe a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent\\r\\nof him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.  I hate such\\r\\nfalse friends.  Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as\\r\\nhis father did before him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on\\r\\nthat head, as you will hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                      \"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\\r\\n                                                   \"15th October.\\r\\n\"Dear Sir,--\\r\\n\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late\\r\\nhonoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I\\r\\nhave had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to\\r\\nheal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own\\r\\ndoubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for\\r\\nme to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always\\r\\npleased him to be at variance,--  \\'There, Mrs. Bennet.\\'-- My\\r\\nmind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\\r\\nreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\\r\\ndistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose\\r\\nbounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory\\r\\nof this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean\\r\\nmyself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever\\r\\nready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted\\r\\nby the Church of England.  As a clergyman,  moreover, I feel it\\r\\nmy duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all\\r\\nfamilies within in the reach of my influence; and on these\\r\\ngrounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly\\r\\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\\r\\nentail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\\r\\nside, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.  I\\r\\ncannot otherwise than be concerned at being the means of\\r\\ninjuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for\\r\\nit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every\\r\\npossible amends-- but of this hereafter.  If you should have no\\r\\nobjection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the\\r\\nsatisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,\\r\\nNovember 18th, by four o\\'clock, and shall probably trespass on\\r\\nyour hospitality till the Saturday se\\'ennight following, which I\\r\\ncan do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from\\r\\nobjecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that\\r\\nsome other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.-- I\\r\\nremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and\\r\\ndaughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\r\\n                                   \"WILLIAM COLLINS\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At four o\\'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making\\r\\ngentleman,\" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.  \"He\\r\\nseems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon\\r\\nmy word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,\\r\\nespecially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him\\r\\ncome to us again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,\\r\\nand if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the\\r\\nperson to discourage him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can\\r\\nmean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is\\r\\ncertainly to his credit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for\\r\\nLady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,\\r\\nand burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she.  \"I cannot make him\\r\\nout.  There is something very pompous in his style.  And what\\r\\ncan he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?  We\\r\\ncannot suppose he would help it if he could.  Could he be a\\r\\nsensible man, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, I think not.  I have great hopes of finding him\\r\\nquite the reverse.  Thee is a mixture of servility and\\r\\nself-importance in his letter, which promises well.  I am\\r\\nimpatient to see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not seem\\r\\ndefective.  The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly\\r\\nnew, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in\\r\\nany degree interesting.  It was next to impossible that their\\r\\ncousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some\\r\\nweeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a\\r\\nman in any other colour.  As for their mother, Mr. Collins\\'s letter\\r\\nhad done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see\\r\\nhim with a degree of composure which astonished her husband\\r\\nand daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with\\r\\ngreat politeness by the whole family.  Mr. Bennet indeed said\\r\\nlittle; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins\\r\\nseemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be\\r\\nsilent himself.  He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of\\r\\nfive-and-twenty.  His air was grave and stately, and his manners\\r\\nwere very formal. He had not been long seated before he\\r\\ncomplimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\r\\ndaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in\\r\\nthis instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that\\r\\nhe did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in\\r\\nmarriage.  This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of\\r\\nhis hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no\\r\\ncompliments, answered most readily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it\\r\\nmay prove so, for else they will be destitute enough.  Things are\\r\\nsettled so oddly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed.  It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\r\\nmust confess.  Not that I mean to find fault with YOU, for such\\r\\nthings I know are all chance in this world.  There is no knowing\\r\\nhow estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\\r\\nand could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of\\r\\nappearing forward and precipitate.  But I can assure the young\\r\\nladies that I come prepared to admire them.  At present I will\\r\\nnot say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\\r\\non each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collin\\'s\\r\\nadmiration.  The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were\\r\\nexamined and praised; and his commendation of everything\\r\\nwould have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s heart, but for the mortifying\\r\\nsupposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.  The\\r\\ndinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to\\r\\nknow to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking\\r\\nwas owing.  But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\\r\\nassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to\\r\\nkeep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in\\r\\nthe kitchen.  He begged pardon for having displeased her.  In a\\r\\nsoftened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he\\r\\ncontinued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 14\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the\\r\\nservants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some\\r\\nconversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\\r\\nwhich he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed\\r\\nvery fortunate in his patroness.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\'s\\r\\nattention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort,\\r\\nappeared very remarkable.  Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\r\\nbetter.  Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.  The subject\\r\\nelevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a\\r\\nmost important aspect he protested that \"he had never in his life\\r\\nwitnessed such behaviour in a person of rank-- such affability\\r\\nand condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  She had been graciously pleased to approve of both\\r\\nof the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\r\\npreaching before her.  She had also asked him twice to dine at\\r\\nRosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make\\r\\nup her pool of quadrille in the evening.  Lady Catherine was\\r\\nreckoned proud by many people he knew, but HE had never\\r\\nseen anything but affability in her.  She had always spoken to\\r\\nhim as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the\\r\\nsmallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\r\\nneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a\\r\\nweek or two, to visit his relations.  She had even condescended\\r\\nto advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose\\r\\nwith discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble\\r\\nparsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations\\r\\nhe had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some\\r\\nherself-- some shelves in the closet upstairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.  It is a pity that\\r\\ngreat ladies in general are not more like her.  Does she live near\\r\\nyou, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only\\r\\nby a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir?  Has she any family?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\r\\nextensive property.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off\\r\\nthan many girls.  And what sort of young lady is she?  Is she\\r\\nhandsome?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine\\r\\nherself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far\\r\\nsuperior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in\\r\\nher features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\\r\\nShe is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented\\r\\nher from making that progress in many accomplishments which\\r\\nshe could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the\\r\\nlady who superintended her education, and who still resides with\\r\\nthem.  But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to\\r\\ndrive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among\\r\\nthe ladies at court.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in\\r\\ntown; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has\\r\\ndeprived the British court of its brightest ornaments.  Her\\r\\nladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that\\r\\nI am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate\\r\\ncompliments which are always acceptable to ladies.  I have more\\r\\nthan once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming\\r\\ndaughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\r\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be\\r\\nadorned by her.  These are the kind of little things which please\\r\\nher ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself\\r\\npeculiarly bound to pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for\\r\\nyou that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.  May I\\r\\nask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse\\r\\nof the moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though\\r\\nI sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such\\r\\nlittle elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary\\r\\noccasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s expectations were fully answered.  His cousin was\\r\\nas absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the\\r\\nkeenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most\\r\\nresolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional\\r\\nglance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr.\\r\\nBennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again,\\r\\nand, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the\\r\\nladies.  Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced;\\r\\nbut, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a\\r\\ncirculating library), he started back, and begging pardon,\\r\\nprotested that he never read novels.  Kitty stared at him, and\\r\\nLydia exclaimed.  Other books were produced, and after some\\r\\ndeliberation he chose Fordyce\\'s Sermons.  Lydia gaped as he\\r\\nopened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous\\r\\nsolemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning\\r\\naway Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.  My\\r\\naunt told me so herself on Saturday.  I shall walk to Meryton\\r\\nto-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny\\r\\ncomes back from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but\\r\\nMr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by\\r\\nbooks of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.\\r\\nIt amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so\\r\\nadvantageous to them as instruction.  But I will no longer\\r\\nimportune my young cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist\\r\\nat backgammon.  Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing\\r\\nthat he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling\\r\\namusements.  Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most\\r\\ncivilly for Lydia\\'s interruption, and promised that it should not\\r\\noccur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after\\r\\nassuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and\\r\\nshould never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself\\r\\nat another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for\\r\\nbackgammon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature\\r\\nhad been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest\\r\\npart of his life having been spent under the guidance of an\\r\\nilliterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of\\r\\nthe universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without\\r\\nforming at it any useful acquaintance.  The subjection in which\\r\\nhis father had brought him up had given him originally great\\r\\nhumility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by\\r\\nthe self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the\\r\\nconsequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.  A\\r\\nfortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\r\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect\\r\\nwhich he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his\\r\\npatroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his\\r\\nauthority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him\\r\\naltogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness,\\r\\nself-importance and humility.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he\\r\\nintended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the\\r\\nLongbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose\\r\\none of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable\\r\\nas they were represented by common report.  This was his plan\\r\\noff amends-- of atonement-- for inheriting their father\\'s estate;\\r\\nand he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\r\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his\\r\\nown part.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.  Miss Bennet\\'s lovely face\\r\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of\\r\\nwhat was due to seniority; and for the first evening SHE was his\\r\\nsettled choice.  The next morning, however, made an alteration;\\r\\nfor in a quarter of an hour\\'s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before\\r\\nbreakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house,\\r\\nand leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress\\r\\nmight be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid\\r\\nvery complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution\\r\\nagainst the very Jane he had fixed on.  \"As to her YOUNGER\\r\\ndaughters, she could not take upon her to say-- she could not\\r\\npositively answer-- but she did not KNOW of any prepossession;\\r\\nher ELDEST daughter, she must just mention-- she felt it\\r\\nincumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth-- and it\\r\\nwas soon done-- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.\\r\\nElizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded\\r\\nher of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might\\r\\nsoon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could\\r\\nnot bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good\\r\\ngraces.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten;\\r\\nevery sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most\\r\\nanxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for\\r\\nthither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he\\r\\nwould continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios\\r\\nin the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little\\r\\ncessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.  Such doings\\r\\ndiscomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.  In his library he had been\\r\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as\\r\\nhe told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other\\r\\nroom of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his\\r\\ncivility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to\\r\\njoin his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact\\r\\nmuch better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely\\r\\npleased to close his large book, and go.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\r\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.  The\\r\\nattention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by\\r\\nhim.  Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in\\r\\nquest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet\\r\\nindeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,\\r\\nwhom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike\\r\\nappearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the\\r\\nway.  The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose\\r\\nreturn from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as\\r\\nthey passed.  All were struck with the stranger\\'s air, all\\r\\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\\r\\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense\\r\\nof wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had\\r\\njust gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back,\\r\\nhad reached the same spot.  Mr. Denny addressed them directly,\\r\\nand entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nwho had returned with him the day before from town, and he\\r\\nwas happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.\\r\\nThis was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only\\r\\nregimentals to make him completely charming.  His appearance\\r\\nwas greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a\\r\\nfine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.  The\\r\\nintroduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of\\r\\nconversation-- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\\r\\nunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking\\r\\ntogether very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their\\r\\nnotice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.\\r\\nOn distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen\\r\\ncame directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.\\r\\nBingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\\r\\nprincipal object.  He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn\\r\\non purpose to inquire after her.  Mr. Darcy corroborated it with\\r\\na bow, an was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on\\r\\nElizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\r\\nstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of\\r\\nboth as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the\\r\\neffect of the meeting.  Both changed colour, one looked white,\\r\\nthe other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his\\r\\nhat-- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What\\r\\ncould be the meaning of it?  It was impossible to imagine; it was\\r\\nimpossible not to long to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have\\r\\nnoticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to\\r\\nthe door of Mr. Phillip\\'s house, and then made their bows, in\\r\\nspite of Miss Lydia\\'s pressing entreaties that they should come\\r\\nin, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips\\'s throwing up the parlour\\r\\nwindow and loudly seconding the invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two\\r\\neldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and\\r\\nshe was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return\\r\\nhome, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she\\r\\nshould have known nothing about, if she had not happened to\\r\\nsee Mr. Jones\\'s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that\\r\\nthey were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because\\r\\nthe Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was\\r\\nclaimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\\'s introduction of him.  She\\r\\nreceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned\\r\\nwith as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any\\r\\nprevious acquaintance with her, which he could not help\\r\\nflattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship\\r\\nto the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.  Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but\\r\\nher contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by\\r\\nexclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however,\\r\\nshe could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.\\r\\nDenny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\r\\nlieutenant\\'s commission in the ----shire.  She had been watching\\r\\nhim the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,\\r\\nand had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly\\r\\nhave continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed\\r\\nwindows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison\\r\\nwith the stranger, were become \"stupid, disagreeable fellows.\"\\r\\nSome of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and\\r\\ntheir aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nand give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\r\\nwould come in the evening.  This was agreed to, and Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy\\r\\ngame of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.\\r\\nThe prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted\\r\\nin mutual good spirits.  Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in\\r\\nquitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that\\r\\nthey were perfectly needless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had\\r\\nseen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would\\r\\nhave defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the\\r\\nwrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by\\r\\nadmiring Mrs. Phillips\\'s manners and politeness.  He protested\\r\\nthat, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen\\r\\na more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with\\r\\nthe utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her\\r\\ninvitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her\\r\\nbefore.  Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his\\r\\nconnection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\\r\\nattention in the whole course of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs no objection was made to the young people\\'s engagement\\r\\nwith their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\\'s scruples of leaving Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most\\r\\nsteadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at\\r\\na suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nhad accepted their uncle\\'s invitation, and was then in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their\\r\\nseats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,\\r\\nand he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the\\r\\napartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed\\r\\nhimself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a\\r\\ncomparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but\\r\\nwhen Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and\\r\\nwho was its proprietor-- when she had listened to the description\\r\\nof only one of Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-rooms, and found that\\r\\nthe chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt\\r\\nall the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented\\r\\na comparison with the housekeeper\\'s room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\\r\\nmansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\\r\\nabode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily\\r\\nemployed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his\\r\\nconsequence increased with what she heard, and who was\\r\\nresolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she\\r\\ncould.  To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and\\r\\nwho had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and\\r\\nexamine their own indifferent imitations of china on the\\r\\nmantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.  It was\\r\\nover at last, however.  The gentlemen did approach, and when\\r\\nMr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had\\r\\nneither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with\\r\\nthe smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of\\r\\nthe ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set,\\r\\nand the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.\\r\\nWickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air,\\r\\nand walk, as THEY were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy\\r\\nuncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every\\r\\nfemale eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by\\r\\nwhom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in\\r\\nwhich he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only\\r\\non its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest,\\r\\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by\\r\\nthe skill of the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and\\r\\nthe officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to\\r\\nthe young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at\\r\\nintervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her\\r\\nwatchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\r\\nWhen the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of\\r\\nobliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be\\r\\nglad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nwas very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his\\r\\nreason.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\r\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.  At first\\r\\nthere seemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she\\r\\nwas a most determined talked; but being likewise extremely fond\\r\\nof lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the\\r\\ngame, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to\\r\\nhave attention for anyone in particular.  Allowing for the\\r\\ncommon demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at\\r\\nleisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\\r\\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\\r\\ntold-- the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.  She dared\\r\\nnot even mention that gentleman.  Her curiosity, however, was\\r\\nunexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.\\r\\nHe inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after\\r\\nreceiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr.\\r\\nDarcy had been staying there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the\\r\\nsubject drop, added, \"he is a man of very large property in\\r\\nDerbyshire, I understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one.  A\\r\\nclear ten thousand per annum.  You could not have met with a\\r\\nperson more capable of giving you certain information on that\\r\\nhead than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a\\r\\nparticular manner from my infancy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,\\r\\nafter seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our\\r\\nmeeting yesterday.  Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly.  \"I\\r\\nhave spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him\\r\\nvery disagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no right to give MY opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his\\r\\nbeing agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified to form one.  I\\r\\nhave known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.  It is\\r\\nimpossible for ME to be impartial.  But I believe your opinion of\\r\\nhim would in general astonish-- and perhaps you would not\\r\\nexpress it quite so strongly anywhere else.  Here you are in your\\r\\nown family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I say no more HERE than I might say in any\\r\\nhouse in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.  He is not at all\\r\\nliked in Hertfordshire.  Everybody is disgusted with his pride.\\r\\nYou will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\r\\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated\\r\\nbeyond their deserts; but with HIM I believe it does not often\\r\\nhappen.  The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence,\\r\\nor frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him\\r\\nonly as he chooses to be seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI should take him, even on MY slight acquaintance, to be an\\r\\n ill-tempered man.\"  Wickham shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\\r\\n\"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not at all know; but I HEARD nothing of his going away\\r\\nwhen I was at Netherfield.  I hope your plans in favour of the\\r\\n----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no-- it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.  If\\r\\nHE wishes to avoid seeing ME, he must go.  We are not on\\r\\nfriendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I\\r\\nhave no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim\\r\\nbefore all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\\r\\npainful regrets at his being what he is.  His father, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthe late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,\\r\\nand the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company\\r\\nwith this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\r\\nthousand tender recollections.  His behaviour to myself has been\\r\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\r\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and\\r\\ndisgracing  the memory of his father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened\\r\\nwith all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton,\\r\\nthe neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all\\r\\nthat he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but\\r\\nvery intelligible gallantry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he\\r\\nadded, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.  I\\r\\nknew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend\\r\\nDenny tempted me further by his account of their present\\r\\nquarters, and the very great attentions and excellent\\r\\nacquaintances Meryton had procured them.  Society, I own, is\\r\\nnecessary to me.  I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits\\r\\nwill not bear solitude.  I MUST have employment and society.\\r\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances\\r\\nhave now made it eligible.  The church OUGHT to have been\\r\\nmy profession-- I was brought up for the church, and I should at\\r\\nthis time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it\\r\\npleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation\\r\\nof the best living in his gift.  He was my godfather, and\\r\\nexcessively attached to me.  I cannot do justice to his kindness.\\r\\nHe meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it;\\r\\nbut when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could THAT be?\\r\\nHow could his will be disregarded?  Why did you not seek legal\\r\\nredress?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest\\r\\nas to give me no hope from law.  A man of honour could not\\r\\nhave doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it-- or\\r\\nto treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert\\r\\nthat I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence--\\r\\nin short anything or nothing.  Certain it is, that the living became\\r\\nvacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and\\r\\nthat it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I\\r\\ncannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve\\r\\nto lose it.  I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have\\r\\nspoken my opinion OF him, and TO him, too freely.  I can recall\\r\\nnothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very different sort of\\r\\nmen, and that he hates me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is quite shocking!  He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some time or other he WILL be-- but it shall not be by ME.\\r\\nTill I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose HIM.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\\r\\nhandsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?\\r\\nWhat can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me-- a dislike which I cannot\\r\\nbut attribute in some measure to jealousy.  Had the late Mr.\\r\\nDarcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better;\\r\\nbut his father\\'s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I\\r\\nbelieve, very early in life.  He had not a temper to bear the sort of\\r\\ncompetition in which we stood-- the sort of preference which\\r\\nwas often given me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this-- though I have\\r\\nnever liked him.  I had not thought so very ill of him.  I had\\r\\nsupposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but\\r\\ndid not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge,\\r\\nsuch injustice, such inhumanity as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few minutes\\' reflection, however, she continued, \"I DO\\r\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\\r\\nimplacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\\r\\ntemper.  His disposition must be dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\ncan hardly be just to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\\r\\n\"to treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of\\r\\nhis father!\"  She could have added, \"a young man, too, like\\r\\nYOU, whose very countenance may vouch for your being\\r\\namiable\"-- but she contented herself with, \"and one, too, who\\r\\nhad probably been his companion from childhood, connected\\r\\ntogether, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the\\r\\ngreatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the\\r\\nsame house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same\\r\\nparental care.  MY father began life in the profession which your\\r\\nuncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to-- but he\\r\\ngave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and\\r\\ndevoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.  He\\r\\nwas most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate,\\r\\nconfidential friend.  Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be\\r\\nunder the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active\\r\\nsuperintendence, and when, immediately before my father\\'s\\r\\ndeath, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for\\r\\nme, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of\\r\\ngratitude to HIM, as of his affection to myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"How abominable!  I wonder\\r\\nthat the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to\\r\\nyou!  If from no better motive, that he should not have been too\\r\\nproud to be dishonest-- for dishonesty I must call it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It IS wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions\\r\\nmay be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\\r\\nIt has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other\\r\\nfeeling.  But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour\\r\\nto me there were stronger impulses even than pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.  It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his\\r\\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and\\r\\nrelieve the poor.  Family pride, and FILIAL pride-- for he is very\\r\\nproud of what his father was-- have done this.  Not to appear to\\r\\ndisgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or\\r\\nlose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.\\r\\nHe has also BROTHERLY pride, which, with SOME brotherly\\r\\naffection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his\\r\\nsister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most\\r\\nattentive and best of brothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.  \"I wish I could call her amiable.  It gives me\\r\\npain to speak ill of a Darcy.  But she is too much like her\\r\\nbrother-- very, very proud.  As a child, she was affectionate and\\r\\npleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours\\r\\nand hours to her amusement.  But she is nothing to me now.\\r\\nShe is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I\\r\\nunderstand, highly accomplished.  Since her father\\'s death, her\\r\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and\\r\\nsuperintends her education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!  How can Mr.\\r\\nBingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,\\r\\ntruly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?  How can they\\r\\nsuit each other?  Do you know Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.  He cannot\\r\\nknow what Mr. Darcy is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.  He\\r\\ndoes not want abilities.  He can be a conversible companion if he\\r\\nthinks it worth his while.  Among those who are at all his equals\\r\\nin consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the\\r\\nless prosperous.  His pride never deserts him; but with the rich\\r\\nhe is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and\\r\\nperhaps agreeable-- allowing something for fortune and figure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players\\r\\ngathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station\\r\\nbetween his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips.  The usual\\r\\ninquiries as to his success was made by the latter.  It had not\\r\\nbeen very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nbegan to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with\\r\\nmuch earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that\\r\\nhe considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she\\r\\nwould not make herself uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down\\r\\nto a card table, they must take their chances of these things, and\\r\\nhappily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings\\r\\nany object.  There are undoubtedly many who could not say the\\r\\nsame, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed\\r\\nfar beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr,.\\r\\nCollins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\\r\\nwhether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the\\r\\nfamily of de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given\\r\\nhim a living.  I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first\\r\\nintroduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her\\r\\nlong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady\\r\\nAnne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the\\r\\npresent Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I did not.  I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nconnections.  I never heard of her existence till the day before\\r\\nyesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,\\r\\nand it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two\\r\\nestates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor\\r\\nMiss Bingley.  Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and\\r\\nuseless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he\\r\\nwere already self-destined for another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine\\r\\nand her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related\\r\\nof her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in\\r\\nspite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited\\r\\nwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\nhave not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that\\r\\nI never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and\\r\\ninsolent.  She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible\\r\\nand clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities\\r\\nfrom her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,\\r\\nand the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that\\r\\nevery one connected with him should have an understanding of\\r\\nthe first class.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it,\\r\\nand they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till\\r\\nsupper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their\\r\\nshare of Mr. Wickham\\'s attentions.  There could be no\\r\\nconversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\\'s supper party, but his\\r\\nmanners recommended him to everybody.  Whatever he said,\\r\\nwas said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwent away with her head full of him.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nbut of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way\\r\\nhome; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\\r\\nas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.\\r\\nLydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost\\r\\nand the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the\\r\\ncivility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the\\r\\nleast regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at\\r\\nsupper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had\\r\\nmore to say than he could well manage before the carriage\\r\\nstopped at Longbourn House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between\\r\\nMr. Wickham and herself.  Jane listened with astonishment and\\r\\nconcern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be\\r\\nso unworthy of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard; and yet, it was not in her\\r\\nnature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable\\r\\nappearance as Wickham.  The possibility of his having endured\\r\\nsuch unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings;\\r\\nand nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of\\r\\nthem both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the\\r\\naccount of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise\\r\\nexplained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some\\r\\nway or other, of which we can form no idea.  Interested people\\r\\nhave perhaps misrepresented each to the other.  It is, in short,\\r\\nimpossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances\\r\\nwhich may have alienated them, without actual blame on either\\r\\nside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got\\r\\nto say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been\\r\\nconcerned in the business?  Do clear THEM too, or we shall be\\r\\nobliged to think ill of somebody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of\\r\\nmy opinion.  My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a\\r\\ndisgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\\'s\\r\\nfavourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to\\r\\nprovide for.  It is impossible.  No man of common humanity, no\\r\\nman who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.\\r\\nCan his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?\\r\\nOh! no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on,\\r\\nthan that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as\\r\\nhe gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned\\r\\nwithout ceremony.  If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.\\r\\nBesides, there was truth in his looks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is difficult indeed-- it is distressing.  One does not know what\\r\\nto think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point-- that Mr.\\r\\nBingley, if he HAD been imposed on, would have much to suffer\\r\\nwhen the affair became public.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery,\\r\\nwhere this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very\\r\\npersons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his\\r\\nsisters came to give their personal invitation for the\\r\\nlong-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the\\r\\nfollowing Tuesday.  The two ladies were delighted to see their\\r\\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\\r\\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since\\r\\ntheir separation.  To the rest of the family they paid little\\r\\nattention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not\\r\\nmuch to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.  They were\\r\\nsoon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which\\r\\ntook their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to\\r\\nescape from Mrs. Bennet\\'s civilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to\\r\\nevery female of the family.  Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as\\r\\ngiven in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly\\r\\nflattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,\\r\\ninstead of a ceremonious card.  Jane pictured to herself a happy\\r\\nevening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of\\r\\nher brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a\\r\\ngreat deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of\\r\\neverything in Mr. Darcy\\'s look and behavior.  The happiness\\r\\nanticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single\\r\\nevent, or any particular person, for though they each, like\\r\\nElizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nhe was be no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\\r\\na ball was, at any rate, a ball.  And even Mary could assure her\\r\\nfamily that she had no disinclination for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is\\r\\nenough-- I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening\\r\\nengagements.  Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself\\r\\none of hose who consider intervals of recreation and amusement\\r\\nas desirable for everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she\\r\\ndid not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not\\r\\nhelp asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\\'s\\r\\ninvitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join\\r\\nin the evening\\'s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find\\r\\nthat he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was\\r\\nvery far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a\\r\\nball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to\\r\\nrespectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far\\r\\nfrom objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\\r\\nhonoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of\\r\\nthe evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss\\r\\nElizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which\\r\\nI trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to\\r\\nany disrespect for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in.  She had fully\\r\\nproposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances;\\r\\nand to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been\\r\\nworse times.  There was no help for it, however.  Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little\\r\\nlonger, and Mr. Collins\\' proposal accepted with as good a grace\\r\\nas she could.  She was not better the pleased with his gallantry\\r\\nfrom the idea it suggested of something more.  It now first\\r\\nstruck her, that SHE was selected from among her sisters as\\r\\nworthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of\\r\\nassisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of\\r\\nmore eligible visitors.  The idea soon reached to conviction, as\\r\\nshe observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard\\r\\nhis frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and\\r\\nthough more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of\\r\\nher charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to\\r\\nunderstand that the probability of their marriage was extremely\\r\\nagreeable to HER.  Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take\\r\\nthe hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\r\\nconsequence of any reply.  Mr. Collins might never make the\\r\\noffer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk\\r\\nof, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable\\r\\nstate at this time, for form the day of the invitation, to the day of\\r\\nthe ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their\\r\\nwalking to Meryton once.  No aunt, no officers, no news could\\r\\nbe sought after-- the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by\\r\\nproxy.  Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her\\r\\npatience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of\\r\\nher acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a\\r\\ndance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday,\\r\\nSunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and\\r\\nlooked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats\\r\\nthere assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred\\r\\nto her.  The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by\\r\\nany of those recollections that might not unreasonably have\\r\\nalarmed her.  She had dressed with more than usual care, and\\r\\nprepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that\\r\\nremained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more\\r\\nthan might be won in the course of the evening.  But in an\\r\\ninstant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely\\r\\nomitted for Mr. Darcy\\'s pleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the\\r\\nofficers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute\\r\\nfact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to\\r\\nwhom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham\\r\\nhad been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and\\r\\nwas not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, \"I do not\\r\\nimagine his business would have called him away just now, if he\\r\\nhad not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\\r\\ncaught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\\r\\nless answerable for Wickham\\'s absence than if her first surmise\\r\\nhad been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former\\r\\nwas so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could\\r\\nhardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which\\r\\nhe directly afterwards approached to make.  Attendance,\\r\\nforbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.  She\\r\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\\r\\nturned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not\\r\\nwholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind\\r\\npartiality provoked her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every\\r\\nprospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not\\r\\ndwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was\\r\\nsoon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her\\r\\ncousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.  The first\\r\\ntwo dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were\\r\\ndances of mortification.  Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\r\\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong\\r\\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery\\r\\nwhich disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.  The\\r\\nmoment of her release from him was ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of\\r\\ntalking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\\r\\nWhen those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas,\\r\\nand was in conversation with her, when she found herself\\r\\nsuddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by\\r\\nsurprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing\\r\\nwhat she did, she accepted him.  He walked away again\\r\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of\\r\\npresence of mind;  Charlotte tried to console her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heaven forbid!  THAT would be the greatest misfortune of all!\\r\\nTo find a man agreeable whom on is determined to hate!  Do not\\r\\nwish me such an evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy\\r\\napproached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help\\r\\ncautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her\\r\\nfancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of\\r\\na man ten times his consequence.  Elizabeth made no answer,\\r\\nand took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she\\r\\nwas arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nand reading in her neighbours\\' looks, their equal amazement in\\r\\nbeholding it.  They stood for some time without speaking a\\r\\nword; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last\\r\\nthrough the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it;\\r\\ntill suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to\\r\\nher partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight\\r\\nobservation on the dance.  He replied, and was again silent.\\r\\nAfter a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\\r\\nwith:-- \"It is YOUR turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\ntalked about the dance, and YOU ought to make some sort of\\r\\nremark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say\\r\\nshould be said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  That reply will do for the present.  Perhaps by and\\r\\nby I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than\\r\\npublic ones.  But NOW we may be silent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes.  One must speak a little, you know.  It would look\\r\\nodd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the\\r\\nadvantage of SOME, conversation ought to be so arranged, as\\r\\nthat they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do\\r\\nyou imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\r\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.  We are each of an unsocial,\\r\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\r\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down\\r\\nto posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I\\r\\nam sure,\" said he.  \"How near it may be to MINE, I cannot\\r\\npretend to say.  YOU think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone\\r\\ndown the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not\\r\\nvery often walk to Meryton?  She answered in the affirmative,\\r\\nand, unable to resist the temptation, added, \"When you met us\\r\\nthere the other day, we had just been forming a new\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect was immediate.  A deeper shade of hauteur\\r\\noverspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth,\\r\\nthough blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.\\r\\nAt length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, \"Mr.\\r\\nWickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\\r\\nMAKING friends-- whether he may be equally capable of\\r\\nRETAINING them, is less certain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to\\r\\nsuffer from all his life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the\\r\\nsubject.  At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to\\r\\nthem, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the\\r\\nroom; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of\\r\\nsuperior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his\\r\\npartner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.  Such\\r\\nvery superior dancing is not often seen.  It is evident that you\\r\\nbelong to the first circles.  Allow me to say, however, that your\\r\\nfair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have\\r\\nthis pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable\\r\\nevent, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall\\r\\ntake place.  What congratulations will then flow in!  I appeal to\\r\\nMr. Darcy:-- but let me not interrupt you, sir.  You will not\\r\\nthank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\r\\nyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but\\r\\nSir William\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly,\\r\\nand his eyes were directed with a very serious expression\\r\\ntowards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\\r\\nRecovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,\\r\\nand said, \"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what\\r\\nwe were talking of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all.  Sir William could not\\r\\nhave interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for\\r\\nthemselves.  We have tried two or three subjects already without\\r\\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Books-- oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with\\r\\nthe same feelings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at\\r\\nleast be no want of subject.  We may compare our different\\r\\nopinions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always\\r\\nfull of something else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes-- does it?\"\\r\\nsaid he, with a look of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for\\r\\nher thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\\r\\nafterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember\\r\\nhearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,\\r\\nthat you resentment once created was unappeasable.  You are\\r\\nvery cautious, I suppose, as to its BEING CREATED.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their\\r\\nopinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merely to the illustration of YOUR character,\" said she,\\r\\nendeavouring to shake off her gravity.  \"I am trying to make it\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.  \"I do not get on at all.  I hear such\\r\\ndifferent accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may\\r\\nvary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthat you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,\\r\\nas there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no\\r\\ncredit on either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have\\r\\nanother opportunity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly\\r\\nreplied.  She said no more, and they went down the other dance\\r\\nand parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to\\r\\nan equal degree, for in Darcy\\'s breast there was a tolerable\\r\\npowerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon,\\r\\nand directed all his anger against another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards\\r\\nher, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:-- \"So,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George\\r\\nWickham!  Your sister has been talking to me about him, and\\r\\nasking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man\\r\\nquite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he\\r\\nwas the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy\\'s steward.  Let\\r\\nme recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit\\r\\nconfidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\\'s using him\\r\\nill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been\\r\\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\r\\nMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.  I do not know the\\r\\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the\\r\\nleast to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham\\r\\nmentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could\\r\\nnot well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\r\\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the\\r\\nway.  His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,\\r\\nindeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.  I pity you,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really,\\r\\nconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\\r\\nsame,\" said Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him\\r\\nof nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward,\\r\\nand of THAT, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\\r\\nsneer.  \"Excuse my interference: it was kindly meant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.  \"You are much\\r\\nmistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack\\r\\nas this.  I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the\\r\\nmalice of Mr. Darcy.\"  She then sought her eldest sister, who\\r\\nhas undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.\\r\\nJane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of\\r\\nsuch happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\\r\\nsatisfied with the occurrences of the evening.  Elizabeth instantly\\r\\nread her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham,\\r\\nresentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\\r\\nbefore the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling\\r\\nthan her sister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.\\r\\nBut perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of\\r\\nany third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\r\\nsatisfactory to tell you.  Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\r\\nhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\r\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good\\r\\nconduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly\\r\\nconvinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention\\r\\nfrom Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by\\r\\nhis account as well as his sister\\'s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a\\r\\nrespectable young man.  I am afraid he has been very imprudent,\\r\\nand has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\nam satisfied.  But what does he say of the living?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\\r\\nheard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that\\r\\nit was left to him CONDITIONALLY only.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth\\r\\nwarmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by\\r\\nassurances only.  Mr. Bingley\\'s defense of his friend was a very\\r\\nable one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several\\r\\nparts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend\\r\\nhimself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did\\r\\nbefore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,\\r\\nand on which there could be no difference of sentiment.\\r\\nElizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest\\r\\nhopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard, and said\\r\\nall in her power to heighten her confidence in it.  On their being\\r\\njoined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss\\r\\nLucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner\\r\\nshe had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\r\\nand told her with great exultation that he had just been so\\r\\nfortunate as to make a most important discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is\\r\\nnow in the room a near relation of my patroness.  I happened to\\r\\noverhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady\\r\\nwho does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss\\r\\nde Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How\\r\\nwonderfully these sort of things occur!  Who would have\\r\\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh in his assembly!  I am most thankful that\\r\\nthe discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him,\\r\\nwhich I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not\\r\\nhaving done it before.  My total ignorance of the connection\\r\\nmust plead my apology.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I am.  I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it\\r\\nearlier.  I believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s NEPHEW.  It will\\r\\nbe in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well\\r\\nyesterday se\\'nnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme,\\r\\nassuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him\\r\\nwithout introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a\\r\\ncompliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary\\r\\nthere should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it\\r\\nmust belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin\\r\\nthe acquaintance.  Mr. Collins listened to her with the\\r\\ndetermined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\\r\\nceased speaking, replied thus:-- \"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have\\r\\nthe highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in\\r\\nall matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit\\r\\nme to say, that there must be a wide difference between the\\r\\nestablished forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\\r\\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I\\r\\nconsider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the\\r\\nhighest rank in the kingdom-- provided that a proper humility of\\r\\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore\\r\\nallow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this\\r\\noccasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point\\r\\nof duty.  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice,\\r\\nwhich on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\\r\\nin the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\\r\\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady\\r\\nlike yourself.\"  And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched,\\r\\nand whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.\\r\\nHer cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though\\r\\nshe could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and\\r\\nsaw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\"\\r\\nand \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"  It vexed her to see him\\r\\nexpose himself to such a man.  Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\r\\nunrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\\r\\ntime to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.  Mr. Collins,\\r\\nhowever, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length\\r\\nof his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a\\r\\nslight bow, and moved another way.  Mr. Collins then returned\\r\\nto Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with\\r\\nmy reception.  Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\\r\\nattention.  He answered me with the utmost civility, and even\\r\\npaid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be certain she could never\\r\\nbestow a favour unworthily.  It was really a very handsome\\r\\nthought.  Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue,\\r\\nshe turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.\\r\\nBingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her\\r\\nobservations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as\\r\\nJane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the\\r\\nfelicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she\\r\\nfelt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to\\r\\nlike Bingley\\'s two sisters.  Her mother\\'s thoughts she plainly saw\\r\\nwere bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near\\r\\nher, lest she might hear too much.  When they sat down to\\r\\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness\\r\\nwhich placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she\\r\\nvexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person\\r\\n(Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her\\r\\nexpectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley.  It\\r\\nwas an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of\\r\\nfatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.  His\\r\\nbeing such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\\r\\nthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\\r\\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters\\r\\nwere of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the\\r\\nconnection as much as she could do.  It was, moreover, such a\\r\\npromising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so\\r\\ngreatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly,\\r\\nit was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her\\r\\nsingle daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be\\r\\nobliged to go into company more than she liked.  It was\\r\\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure,\\r\\nbecause on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less\\r\\nlikely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any\\r\\nperiod of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that\\r\\nLady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate,  though evidently\\r\\nand triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\\r\\nmother\\'s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less\\r\\naudible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could\\r\\nperceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who\\r\\nsat opposite to them.  Her mother only scolded her for being\\r\\nnonsensical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?\\r\\nI am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged\\r\\nto say nothing HE may not like to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it\\r\\nbe for you to offend Mr. Darcy?  You will never recommend\\r\\nyourself to his friend by so doing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence.  Her\\r\\nmother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\\r\\nElizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.\\r\\nShe could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nthough every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for\\r\\nthough he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\r\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.  The\\r\\nexpression of his face changed gradually from indignant\\r\\ncontempt to a composed and steady gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady\\r\\nLucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights\\r\\nwhich she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts\\r\\nof cold ham and chicken.  Elizabeth now began to revive.  But\\r\\nnot long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was\\r\\nover, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of\\r\\nseeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the\\r\\ncompany.  By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did\\r\\nshe endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in\\r\\nvain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\\r\\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations,\\r\\nand she watched her progress through the several stanzas with\\r\\nan impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for\\r\\nMary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a\\r\\nhope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after\\r\\nthe pause of half a minute began another.  Mary\\'s powers were\\r\\nby no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and\\r\\nher manner affected.  Elizabeth was in agonies.  She looked at\\r\\nJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\\r\\ntalking to Bingley.  She looked at his two sisters, and saw them\\r\\nmaking signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who\\r\\ncontinued, however, imperturbably grave.  She looked at her\\r\\nfather to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all\\r\\nnight.  He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second\\r\\nsong, said aloud, \"That will do extremely well, child.  You have\\r\\ndelighted us long enough.  Let the other young ladies have time\\r\\nto exhibit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat\\r\\ndisconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her\\r\\nfather\\'s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.\\r\\nOthers of the party were now applied to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing,\\r\\nI should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company\\r\\nwith an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion,\\r\\nand perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.  I\\r\\ndo not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in\\r\\ndevoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly\\r\\nother things to be attended to.  The rector of a parish has much\\r\\nto do.  In the first place, he must make such an agreement for\\r\\ntithes as a may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his\\r\\npatron.  He must write his own sermons; and the time that\\r\\nremains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\r\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused\\r\\nfrom making as a comfortable as a possible.  And I do not think\\r\\nit of light importance that he should have attentive and\\r\\nconciliatory manner towards everybody, especially towards\\r\\nthose to whom he owes his preferment.  I cannot acquit him of\\r\\nthat duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\\r\\noccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected\\r\\nwith the family.\"  And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\\r\\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as a to be heard by\\r\\nhalf the room.  Many stared-- many smiled; but no one looked\\r\\nmore amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously\\r\\ncommended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and\\r\\nobserved in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a\\r\\nremarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement\\r\\nto expose themselves as a much as a they could during the\\r\\nevening, it would have been impossible for them to play their\\r\\nparts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it\\r\\nfor Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had\\r\\nescaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be\\r\\nmuch distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.\\r\\nThat his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such\\r\\nan opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and\\r\\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\\r\\ngentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more\\r\\nintolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement.  She was\\r\\nteased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her\\r\\nside, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him\\r\\nagain, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In vain did\\r\\nshe entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to\\r\\nintroduce him to any young lady in the room.  He assured her,\\r\\nthat as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his\\r\\nchief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\r\\nher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close\\r\\nto her the whole evening.  There was no arguing upon such a\\r\\nproject.  She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas,\\r\\nwho often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s conversation to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\\'s further\\r\\nnotice; though often standing within a very short distance of her,\\r\\nquite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.  She felt\\r\\nit to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.\\r\\nWickham, and rejoiced in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,\\r\\nand, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their\\r\\ncarriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,\\r\\nwhich gave them time to see how heartily they were wished\\r\\naway by some of the family.  Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely\\r\\nopened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were\\r\\nevidently impatient to have the house to themselves.  They\\r\\nrepulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by\\r\\nso doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very\\r\\nlittle relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was\\r\\ncomplimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of\\r\\ntheir entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had\\r\\nmarked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing at all.\\r\\nMr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.  Mr.\\r\\nBingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from\\r\\nthe rest, and talked only to each other.  Elizabeth preserved as\\r\\nsteady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even\\r\\nLydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional\\r\\nexclamation of \"Lord, how tired I am!\" accompanied by a\\r\\nviolent yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most\\r\\npressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at\\r\\nLongbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to\\r\\nassure him how happy he would make them by eating a family\\r\\ndinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal\\r\\ninvitation.  Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily\\r\\nengaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,\\r\\nafter his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the\\r\\nnext day for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under\\r\\nthe delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary\\r\\npreparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,\\r\\nshe should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in\\r\\nthe course of three or four months.  Of having another daughter\\r\\nmarried to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and\\r\\nwith considerable, though not equal, pleasure.  Elizabeth was the\\r\\nleast dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the\\r\\nmatch were quite good enough for HER, the worth of each was\\r\\neclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmade his declaration in form.  Having resolved to do it without\\r\\nloss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the\\r\\nfollowing Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make\\r\\nit distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a\\r\\nvery orderly manner, with all the observances, which he\\r\\nsupposed a regular part of the business.  On finding Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\\r\\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: \"May I\\r\\nhope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter\\r\\nElizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience\\r\\nwith her in the course of this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!-- yes-- certainly.  I\\r\\nam sure Lizzy will be very happy-- I am sure she can have no\\r\\nobjection, Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.\"  And, gathering\\r\\nher work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\\r\\ncalled out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam, do not go.  I beg you will not go.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmust excuse me.  He can have nothing to say to me that anybody\\r\\nneed not hear.  I am going away myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.  I desire you to stay where you are.\"\\r\\nAnd upon Elizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and\\r\\nembarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \"Lizzy, I\\r\\nINSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth would not oppose such and injunction-- and a\\r\\nmoment\\'s consideration making her also sensible that it would\\r\\nbe wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat\\r\\ndown again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the\\r\\nfeelings which were divided between distress and diversion.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were\\r\\ngone, Mr. Collins began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far\\r\\nfrom doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\\r\\nperfections.  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had\\r\\nthere NOT been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure\\r\\nyou, that I have your respected mother\\'s permission for this\\r\\naddress.  You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,\\r\\nhowever your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my\\r\\nattentions have been too marked to be mistaken.  Almost as\\r\\nsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion\\r\\nof my future life.  But before I am run away with by my feelings\\r\\non this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state\\r\\nmy reasons for marrying-- and, moreover, for coming into\\r\\nHertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being\\r\\nrun away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing,\\r\\nthat she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt\\r\\nto stop him further, and he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing\\r\\nfor every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set\\r\\nthe example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am\\r\\nconvinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and\\r\\nthirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it\\r\\nis the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble\\r\\nlady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has\\r\\nshe condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\r\\nsubject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\r\\nHunsford-- between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson\\r\\nwas arranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said,  \\'Mr.\\r\\nCollins, you must marry.  A clergyman like you must marry.\\r\\nChoose properly, choose a gentlewoman for MY sake; and for\\r\\nyour OWN, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought\\r\\nup high, but able to make a small income go a good way.  This is\\r\\nmy advice.  Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to\\r\\nHunsford, and I will visit her.\\'  Allow me, by the way, to\\r\\nobserve, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\r\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\r\\nadvantages in my power to offer.  You will find her manners\\r\\nbeyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I\\r\\nthink, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with\\r\\nthe silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.\\r\\nThus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it\\r\\nremains to be told why my views were directed towards\\r\\nLongbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can\\r\\nassure you there are many amiable young women.  But the fact\\r\\nis, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of\\r\\nyour honoured father (who, however, may live many years\\r\\nlonger), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a\\r\\nwife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as\\r\\nlittle as possible, when the melancholy event takes place-- which,\\r\\nhowever, as I have already said, may not be for several years.\\r\\nThis has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it\\r\\nwill not sink me in your esteem.  And now nothing remains but\\r\\nfor me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\r\\nviolence of my affection.  To fortune I am perfectly indifferent,\\r\\nand shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I\\r\\nam well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one\\r\\nthousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours\\r\\ntill after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be\\r\\nentitled to.  On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent;\\r\\nand you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall\\r\\never pass my lips when we are married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried.  \"You forget that I have\\r\\nmade no answer.  Let me do it without further loss of time.\\r\\nAccept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.  I am\\r\\nvery sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is\\r\\nimpossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave\\r\\nof the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the\\r\\naddresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when\\r\\nhe first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is\\r\\nrepeated a second, or even a third time.  I am therefore by no\\r\\nmeans discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to\\r\\nlead you to the altar ere long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\\r\\nextraordinary one after my declaration.  I do assure you that I\\r\\nam not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)\\r\\nwho are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of\\r\\nbeing asked a second time.  I am perfectly serious in my refusal.\\r\\nYou could not make ME happy, and I am convinced that I am\\r\\nthe last woman in the world who could make you so.  Nay, were\\r\\nyour friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she\\r\\nwould find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr.\\r\\nCollins very gravely-- \"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship\\r\\nwould at all disapprove of you.  And you may be certain when I\\r\\nhave the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very\\r\\nhighest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable\\r\\nqualification.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.  You\\r\\nmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the\\r\\ncompliment of believing what I say.  I wish you very happy and\\r\\nvery rich, and by refusing you hand, do all in my power to\\r\\nprevent your being otherwise.  In making me the offer, you must\\r\\nhave satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my\\r\\nfamily, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever\\r\\nit falls, without any self-reproach.  This matter may be\\r\\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.\"  And rising as she thus\\r\\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not\\r\\nthus addressed her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the\\r\\nsubject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than\\r\\nyou have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of\\r\\ncruelty at present, because I know it to be the established\\r\\ncustom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and\\r\\nperhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit\\r\\nas would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female\\r\\ncharacter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you\\r\\npuzzle me exceedingly.  If what I have hitherto said can appear\\r\\nto you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express\\r\\nmy refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that\\r\\nyour refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.  My\\r\\nreasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to\\r\\nme that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the\\r\\nestablishment I can offer would be any other than highly\\r\\ndesirable.  My situation in life, my connections with the family of\\r\\nde Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances\\r\\nhighly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\r\\nconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by\\r\\nno means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be\\r\\nmade you.  Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all\\r\\nlikelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable\\r\\nqualifications.  As I must therefore conclude that you are not\\r\\nserious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to\\r\\nyour wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the\\r\\nusual practice of elegant females.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that\\r\\nkind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.\\r\\nI would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.\\r\\nI thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in\\r\\nyour proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.  My\\r\\nfeelings in every respect forbid it.  Can I speak plainer?  Do not\\r\\nconsider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you,\\r\\nbut as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\\r\\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the\\r\\nexpress authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals\\r\\nwill not fail of being acceptable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would\\r\\nmake no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew,\\r\\ndetermined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated\\r\\nrefusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father,\\r\\nwhose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be\\r\\ndecisive, and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for\\r\\nthe affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\r\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the\\r\\nvestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw\\r\\nElizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards\\r\\nthe staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and\\r\\ncongratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy\\r\\nprospect or their nearer connection.  Mr. Collins received and\\r\\nreturned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\r\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the\\r\\nresult of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied,\\r\\nsince the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him\\r\\nwould naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine\\r\\ndelicacy of her character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would\\r\\nhave been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had\\r\\nmeant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but\\r\\nshe dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall\\r\\nbe brought to reason.  I will speak to her about it directly.  She\\r\\nis a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own\\r\\ninterest but I will MAKE her know it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins;\\r\\n\"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether\\r\\nshe would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my\\r\\nsituation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage\\r\\nstate.  If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,\\r\\nperhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,\\r\\nbecause if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\\r\\ncontribute much to my felicity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\\r\\n\"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.  In everything\\r\\nelse she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.  I will go directly\\r\\nto Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am\\r\\nsure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to\\r\\nher husband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh! Mr.\\r\\nBennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\r\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows\\r\\nshe will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will\\r\\nchange his mind and not have HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and\\r\\nfixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in\\r\\nthe least altered by her communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when\\r\\nshe had finished her speech.  \"Of what are you talking?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have\\r\\nLizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?  It seems an hopeless\\r\\nbusiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.  Tell her that you insist upon\\r\\nher marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let her be called down.  She shall hear my opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to\\r\\nthe library.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared.  \"I have\\r\\nsent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand that Mr.\\r\\nCollins has made you an offer of marriage.  Is it true?\"  Elizabeth\\r\\nreplied that it was.  \"Very well-- and this offer of marriage you\\r\\nhave refused?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother insists\\r\\nupon your accepting it.  Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.  From this day\\r\\nyou must be a stranger to one of your parents.  Your mother will\\r\\nnever see you again if you do NOT marry Mr. Collins, and I will\\r\\nnever see you again if you DO.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a\\r\\nbeginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her\\r\\nhusband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively\\r\\ndisappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?  You\\r\\npromised me to INSIST upon her marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to\\r\\nrequest.  First, that you will allow me the free use of my\\r\\nunderstanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my\\r\\nroom.  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as\\r\\nmay be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\\r\\ndid Mrs. Bennet give up the point.  She talked to Elizabeth again\\r\\nand again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.  She endeavoured\\r\\nto secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible\\r\\nmildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with\\r\\nreal earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to\\r\\nher attacks.  Though her manner varied, however, her\\r\\ndetermination never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\\r\\npassed.  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what\\r\\nmotives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was\\r\\nhurt, he suffered in no other way.  His regard for her was quite\\r\\nimaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\\'s\\r\\nreproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\\r\\nspend the day with them.  She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,\\r\\nwho, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are\\r\\ncome, for there is such fun here!  What do you think has\\r\\nhappened this morning?  Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy,\\r\\nand she will not have him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\\r\\nKitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they\\r\\nentered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than\\r\\nshe likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her\\r\\ncompassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to\\r\\ncomply with the wishes of all her family.  \"Pray do, my dear\\r\\nMiss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on\\r\\nmy side, nobody takes part with me.  I am cruelly used, nobody\\r\\nfeels for my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as\\r\\nunconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we\\r\\nwere at York, provided she can have her own way.  But I tell\\r\\nyou, Miss Lizzy-- if you take it into your head to go on refusing\\r\\nevery offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband\\r\\nat all-- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  I shall not be able to keep you--\\r\\nand so I warn you.  I have done with you from this very day.  I\\r\\ntold you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to\\r\\nyou again, and you will find me as good as my word.  I have no\\r\\npleasure in talking to undutiful children.  Not that I have much\\r\\npleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.  People who suffer as I\\r\\ndo from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for\\r\\ntalking.  Nobody can tell what I suffer!  But it is always so.\\r\\nThose who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\r\\nany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only\\r\\nincrease the irritation.  She talked on, therefore, without\\r\\ninterruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.\\r\\nCollins, who entered the room with an air more stately than\\r\\nusual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, \"Now, I do\\r\\ninsist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me\\r\\nand Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty\\r\\nfollowed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she\\r\\ncould; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nwhose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute,\\r\\nand then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the\\r\\nwindow and pretending not to hear.  In a doleful voice Mrs.\\r\\nBennet began the projected conversation: \"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam, \" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this\\r\\npoint.  Far be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a voice that\\r\\nmarked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter.\\r\\nResignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the\\r\\npeculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I\\r\\nhave been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.\\r\\nPerhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive\\r\\nhappiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\\r\\nhave often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when\\r\\nthe blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\r\\nestimation.  You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any\\r\\ndisrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing\\r\\nmy pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without having paid\\r\\nyourself and Mr. Bennet to compliment of requesting you to\\r\\ninterpose your authority in my behalf.  My conduct may, I fear,\\r\\nbe objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your\\r\\ndaughter\\'s lips instead of your own.  But we are all liable to\\r\\nerror.  I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.  My\\r\\nobject has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with\\r\\ndue consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my\\r\\nMANNER has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\\r\\napologise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins\\'s offer was now nearly at an end,\\r\\nand Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings\\r\\nnecessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish\\r\\nallusions of her mother.  As for the gentleman himself, HIS\\r\\nfeelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or\\r\\ndejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner\\r\\nand resentful silence.  He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\\r\\nassiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\\r\\nwere transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\r\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\r\\nespecially to her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\\'s ill-humour\\r\\nor ill health.  Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry\\r\\npride.  Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his\\r\\nvisit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.  He\\r\\nwas always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant\\r\\nto stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.\\r\\nWickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from\\r\\nthe Netherfield ball.  He joined them on their entering the town,\\r\\nand attended them to their aunt\\'s where his regret and vexation,\\r\\nand the concern of everybody, was well talked over.  To\\r\\nElizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the\\r\\nnecessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not\\r\\nmeet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party\\r\\nwith him for so many hours together, might be more than I could\\r\\nbear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a\\r\\nfull discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they\\r\\ncivilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer\\r\\nwalked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he\\r\\nparticularly attended to her.  His accompanying them was a\\r\\ndouble advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to\\r\\nherself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing\\r\\nhim to her father and mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it\\r\\ncame from Netherfield.  The envelope contained a sheet of\\r\\nelegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s fair,\\r\\nflowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change\\r\\nas she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular\\r\\npassages.  Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter\\r\\naway, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general\\r\\nconversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which\\r\\ndrew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had\\r\\nhe and he companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\\r\\ninvited her to follow her upstairs.  When they had gained their\\r\\nown room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, \"This is from\\r\\nCaroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\\r\\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\\r\\ntheir way to town-- and without any intention of coming back\\r\\nagain.  You shall hear what she says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the\\r\\ninformation of their having just resolved to follow their brother\\r\\nto town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet, where Mr. Hurst had a house.  The next was in these\\r\\nwords: \"I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in\\r\\nHertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we\\r\\nwill hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\r\\ndelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\r\\nlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\r\\nunreserved correspondence.  I depend on you for that.\"  To\\r\\nthese highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the\\r\\ninsensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their\\r\\nremoval surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it\\r\\nwas not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield\\r\\nwould prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as to the loss of\\r\\ntheir society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard\\r\\nit, in the enjoyment of his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should\\r\\nnot be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\\r\\nBut may we not hope that the period of future happiness to\\r\\nwhich Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is\\r\\naware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as\\r\\nfriends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?\\r\\nMr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\r\\nHertfordshire this winter.  I will read it to you:\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the\\r\\nbusiness which took him to London might be concluded in three\\r\\nor four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the\\r\\nsame time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be\\r\\nin no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following\\r\\nhim thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours\\r\\nin a comfortless hotel.  Many of my acquaintances are already\\r\\nthere for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest\\r\\nfriend, had any intention of making one of the crowd-- but of\\r\\nthat I despair.  I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire\\r\\nmay abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings,\\r\\nand that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your\\r\\nfeeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more\\r\\nthis winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\\r\\nSHOULD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why will you think so?  It must be his own doing.  He is his\\r\\nown master.  But you do not know ALL.  I WILL read you the\\r\\npassage which particularly hurts me.  I will have no reserves\\r\\nfrom YOU.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the\\r\\ntruth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again.  I really do\\r\\nnot think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,\\r\\nand accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa\\r\\nand myself is heightened into something still more interesting,\\r\\nfrom the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our\\r\\nsister.  I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you\\r\\nmy feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country\\r\\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\r\\nunreasonable.  My brother admires her greatly already; he will\\r\\nhave frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most\\r\\nintimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as\\r\\nhis own; and a sister\\'s partiality is not misleading me, I think,\\r\\nwhen I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman\\'s\\r\\nheart.  With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and\\r\\nnothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging\\r\\nthe hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?\" said\\r\\nJane as she finished it.  \"Is it not clear enough?  Does it not\\r\\nexpressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to\\r\\nbe her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s\\r\\nindifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for\\r\\nhim, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?  Can\\r\\nthere be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.  Will you hear it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou shall have it in a few words.  Miss Bingley sees that her\\r\\nbrother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\\r\\nShe follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries\\r\\nto persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.  No one who has ever\\r\\nseen you together can doubt his affection.  Miss Bingley, I am\\r\\nsure, cannot.  She is not such a simpleton.  Could she have seen\\r\\nhalf as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have\\r\\nordered her wedding clothes.  But the case is this: We are not\\r\\nrich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more\\r\\nanxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\\r\\nwhen there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less\\r\\ntrouble in achieving a second: in which there is certainly some\\r\\ningenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nwere out of the way.  But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously\\r\\nimagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly\\r\\nadmires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of\\r\\nYOUR merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or\\r\\nthat it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being\\r\\nin love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\r\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy.  But I know\\r\\nthe foundation is unjust.  Caroline is incapable of wilfully\\r\\ndeceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she\\r\\nis deceiving herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is right.  You could not have started a more happy idea,\\r\\nsince you will not take comfort in mine.  Believe her to be\\r\\ndeceived, by all means.  You have now done your duty by her,\\r\\nand must fret no longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\r\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to\\r\\nmarry elsewhere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if, upon\\r\\nmature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his\\r\\ntwo sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his\\r\\nwife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling.  \"You must\\r\\nknow that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their\\r\\ndisapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot\\r\\nconsider your situation with much compassion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\r\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the\\r\\nutmost contempt.  It appeared to her merely the suggestion of\\r\\nCaroline\\'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment\\r\\nsuppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,\\r\\ncould influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\\r\\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy\\r\\neffect.  Jane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was\\r\\ngradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\\r\\nsometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\\r\\nNetherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure\\r\\nof the family, without being alarmed on the score of the\\r\\ngentleman\\'s conduct; but even this partial communication gave\\r\\nher a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly\\r\\nunlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they\\r\\nwere all getting so intimate together.  After lamenting it,\\r\\nhowever, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\r\\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at\\r\\nLongbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable\\r\\ndeclaration, that though he had been invited only to a family\\r\\ndinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again\\r\\nduring the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to\\r\\nMr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.  \"It\\r\\nkeeps him in good humour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to\\r\\nyou than I can express.\"  Charlotte assured her friend of her\\r\\nsatisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the\\r\\nlittle sacrifice of her time.  This was very amiable, but\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any\\r\\nconception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\r\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins\\'s addresses, by engaging them\\r\\ntowards herself.  Such was Miss Lucas\\'s scheme; and\\r\\nappearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night,\\r\\nshe would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been\\r\\nto leave Hertfordshire so very soon.  But here she did injustice\\r\\nto the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to\\r\\nescape out of Longbourn House the next morning with\\r\\nadmirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself\\r\\nat her feet.  He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\r\\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail\\r\\nto conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the\\r\\nattempt known till its success might be known likewise; for\\r\\nthough feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had\\r\\nbeen tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since\\r\\nthe adventure of Wednesday.  His reception, however, was of\\r\\nthe most flattering kind.  Miss Lucas perceived him from an\\r\\nupper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set\\r\\nout to meet him accidentally in the lane.  But little had she dared\\r\\nto hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins\\'s long speeches would allow,\\r\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;\\r\\nand as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name\\r\\nthe day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though\\r\\nsuch a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt\\r\\nno inclination to trifle with his happiness.  The stupidity with\\r\\nwhich he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from\\r\\nany charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance;\\r\\nand Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\\r\\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\r\\nestablishment were gained.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their\\r\\nconsent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.  Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for\\r\\ntheir daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his\\r\\nprospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nbegan directly to calculate, with more interest than the\\r\\nmatter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr.\\r\\nBennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\\r\\nopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\r\\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and\\r\\nhis wife should make their appearance at St. James\\'s. The whole\\r\\nfamily, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.  The\\r\\nyounger girls formed hopes of COMING OUT a year or two\\r\\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were\\r\\nrelieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\\'s dying an old\\r\\nmaid.  Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.  She had\\r\\ngained her point, and had time to consider of it.  Her reflections\\r\\nwere in general satisfactory.  Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither\\r\\nsensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\\r\\nattachment to her must be imaginary.  But still he would be her\\r\\nhusband.  Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,\\r\\nmarriage had always been her object; it was the only provision\\r\\nfor well-educated young women of small fortune, and however\\r\\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\r\\npreservative from want.  This preservative she had now\\r\\nobtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever\\r\\nbeen handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.  The least\\r\\nagreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must\\r\\noccasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued\\r\\nbeyond that of any other person.  Elizabeth would wonder, and\\r\\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to\\r\\nbe shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.\\r\\nShe resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore\\r\\ncharged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\\r\\nto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.  A\\r\\npromise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it\\r\\ncould not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by\\r\\nhis long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his\\r\\nreturn as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the\\r\\nsame time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\r\\npublish his prosperous love.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see\\r\\nany of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed\\r\\nwhen the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with\\r\\ngreat politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to\\r\\nsee him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might\\r\\nallow him to visit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\\r\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\r\\nyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no\\r\\nmeans wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation\\r\\nhere, my good sir?  You had better neglect your relations than\\r\\nrun the risk of offending your patroness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins,\" I am particularly obliged to\\r\\nyou for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not\\r\\ntaking so material a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard.  Risk anything\\r\\nrather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by\\r\\nyour coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly\\r\\nprobable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that WE shall\\r\\ntake no offence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited, by\\r\\nsuch affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily\\r\\nreceive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other\\r\\nmark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.  As for my\\r\\nfair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to\\r\\nrender it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them\\r\\nhealth and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them\\r\\nequally surprised that he meditated a quick return.  Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwished to understand by it that he thought of paying his\\r\\naddresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been\\r\\nprevailed on to accept him.  She rated his abilities much higher\\r\\nthan any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections\\r\\nwhich often struck her, and though by no means so clever as\\r\\nherself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve\\r\\nhimself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\r\\nagreeable companion.  But on the following morning, every\\r\\nhope of this kind was done away.  Miss Lucas called soon after\\r\\nbreakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the\\r\\nevent of the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins\\'s fancying herself in love with her\\r\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two;\\r\\nbut that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far\\r\\nfrom possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her\\r\\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first\\r\\nthe bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins!  My dear Charlotte-- impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in\\r\\ntelling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on\\r\\nreceiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than\\r\\nshe expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?  Do you think it\\r\\nincredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any\\r\\nwoman\\'s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to\\r\\nsucceed with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong\\r\\neffort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the\\r\\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that\\r\\nshe wished her all imaginable happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte.  \"You must be\\r\\nsurprised, very much surprised-- so lately as Mr. Collins was\\r\\nwishing to marry you.  But when you have had time to think it\\r\\nover, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.  I am\\r\\nnot romantic, you know; I never was.  I ask only a comfortable\\r\\nhome; and considering Mr. Collins\\'s character, connection, and\\r\\nsituation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness\\r\\nwith him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the\\r\\nmarriage state.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly\"; and after an\\r\\nawkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.\\r\\nCharlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left\\r\\nto reflect on what she had heard.  It was a long time before she\\r\\nbecame at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.\\r\\nThe strangeness of Mr. Collins\\'s making two offers of marriage\\r\\nwithin three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\r\\naccepted.  She had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of\\r\\nmatrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not\\r\\nsupposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she\\r\\nwould have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.\\r\\nCharlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture!\\r\\nAnd to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her\\r\\nesteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was\\r\\nimpossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\\r\\nchosen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on\\r\\nwhat she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to\\r\\nmention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his\\r\\ndaughter, to announce her engagement to the family.  With many\\r\\ncompliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect\\r\\nof a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter-- to\\r\\nan audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he\\r\\nmust be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\\r\\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?  Do not\\r\\nyou know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have\\r\\nborne without anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good\\r\\nbreeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave\\r\\nto be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all\\r\\ntheir impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so\\r\\nunpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his\\r\\naccount, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte\\r\\nherself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her\\r\\nmother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to\\r\\nSir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by\\r\\nmaking a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be\\r\\nexpected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nand the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great\\r\\ndeal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them\\r\\nthan her feelings found a rapid vent.  In the first place, she\\r\\npersisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she\\r\\nwas very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she\\r\\ntrusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,\\r\\nthat the match might be broken off.  Two inferences, however,\\r\\nwere plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was\\r\\nthe real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had\\r\\nbeen barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points\\r\\nshe principally dwelt during the rest of the day.  Nothing could\\r\\nconsole and nothing could appease her.  Nor did that day wear\\r\\nout her resentment.  A week elapsed before she could see\\r\\nElizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she\\r\\ncould speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude,\\r\\nand many months were gone before she could at all forgive her\\r\\ndaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s emotions were much more tranquil on the\\r\\noccasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of\\r\\na most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover\\r\\nthat Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably\\r\\nsensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his\\r\\ndaughter!\\r\\n\\r\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\\r\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their\\r\\nhappiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as\\r\\nimprobable.  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,\\r\\nfor Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no\\r\\nother way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to\\r\\nretort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well\\r\\nmarried; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual\\r\\nto say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\\'s sour looks and\\r\\nill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which\\r\\nkept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt\\r\\npersuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between\\r\\nthem again.  Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with\\r\\nfonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she\\r\\nwas sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose\\r\\nhappiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been\\r\\ngone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\\r\\ncounting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\\r\\nThe promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on\\r\\nTuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the\\r\\nsolemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\\'s abode in the\\r\\nfamily might have prompted.  After discharging his conscience\\r\\non that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous\\r\\nexpressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of\\r\\ntheir amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it\\r\\nwas merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\\r\\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again\\r\\nat Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday\\r\\nfortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved\\r\\nhis marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,\\r\\nwhich he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his\\r\\namiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\r\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet.  On the contrary, she was as much\\r\\ndisposed to complain of it as her husband.  It was very strange\\r\\nthat he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it\\r\\nwas also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.  She\\r\\nhated having visitors in the house while her health was so\\r\\nindifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.\\r\\nSuch were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave\\r\\nway only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\\'s continued\\r\\nabsence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.\\r\\nDay after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of\\r\\nhim than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his\\r\\ncoming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which\\r\\nhighly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to\\r\\ncontradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear-- not that Bingley was indifferent--\\r\\nbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\\r\\nUnwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\'s\\r\\nhappiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she\\r\\ncould not prevent its frequently occurring.  The united efforts of\\r\\nhis two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted\\r\\nby the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London\\r\\nmight be too much, she feared, for the strength of his\\r\\nattachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of course,\\r\\nmore painful than Elizabeth\\'s, but whatever she felt she was\\r\\ndesirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,\\r\\ntherefore, the subject was never alluded to.  But as no such\\r\\ndelicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which\\r\\nshe did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival,\\r\\nor even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she\\r\\nwould think herself very ill used.  It needed all Jane\\'s steady\\r\\nmildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but\\r\\nhis reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had\\r\\nbeen on his first introduction.  He was too happy, however, to\\r\\nneed much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of\\r\\nlove-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.\\r\\nThe chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he\\r\\nsometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an\\r\\napology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.  The very\\r\\nmention of anything concerning the match threw her into an\\r\\nagony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of\\r\\nhearing it talked of.  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.\\r\\nAs her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous\\r\\nabhorrence.  Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she\\r\\nconcluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\r\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was\\r\\nconvinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and\\r\\nresolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as\\r\\nsoon as Mr. Bennet were dead.  She complained bitterly of all\\r\\nthis to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I\\r\\nshould be forced to make way for HER, and live to see her take\\r\\nher place in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.  Let us\\r\\nhope for better things.  Let us flatter ourselves that I may be\\r\\nthe survivor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead\\r\\nof making any answer, she went on as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.  If it\\r\\nwas not for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\r\\ninsensibility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the\\r\\nentail.  How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an\\r\\nestate from one\\'s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all\\r\\nfor the sake of Mr. Collins too!  Why should HE have it more\\r\\nthan anybody else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.  The very\\r\\nfirst sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in\\r\\nLondon for the winter, and concluded with her brother\\'s regret\\r\\nat not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in\\r\\nHertfordshire before he left the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\\r\\nrest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection\\r\\nof the writer, that could give her any comfort.  Miss Darcy\\'s\\r\\npraise occupied the chief of it.  Her many attractions were again\\r\\ndwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing\\r\\nintimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the\\r\\nwishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.  She wrote\\r\\nalso with great pleasure of her brother\\'s being an inmate of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the\\r\\nlatter with regard to new furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of\\r\\nall this, heard it in silent indignation.  Her heart was divided\\r\\nbetween concern for her sister, and resentment against all others.\\r\\nTo Caroline\\'s assertion of her brother\\'s being partial to Miss\\r\\nDarcy she paid no credit.  That he was really fond of Jane, she\\r\\ndoubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had\\r\\nalways been disposed to like him, she could not think without\\r\\nanger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that\\r\\nwant of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his\\r\\ndesigning friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\r\\nto the caprice of their inclination.  Had his own happiness,\\r\\nhowever, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to\\r\\nsport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister\\'s\\r\\nwas involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.  It\\r\\nwas a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long\\r\\nindulged, and must be unavailing.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nelse; and yet whether Bingley\\'s regard had really died away, or\\r\\nwere suppressed by his friends\\' interference; whether he had\\r\\nbeen aware of Jane\\'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\r\\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him\\r\\nmust be materially affected by the difference, her sister\\'s\\r\\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her\\r\\nfeelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\\'s leaving them\\r\\ntogether, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield\\r\\nand its master, she could not help saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!  She\\r\\ncan have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual\\r\\nreflections on him.  But I will not repine.  It cannot last long.  He\\r\\nwill be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but\\r\\nsaid nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you\\r\\nhave no reason.  He may live in my memory as the most amiable\\r\\nman of my acquaintance, but that is all.  I have nothing either to\\r\\nhope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.  Thank God! I\\r\\nhave not THAT pain. A little time, therefore-- I shall certainly\\r\\ntry to get the better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort\\r\\nimmediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on\\r\\nmy side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good.  Your\\r\\nsweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know\\r\\nwhat to say to you.  I feel as if I had never done you justice, or\\r\\nloved you as you deserve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and\\r\\nthrew back the praise on her sister\\'s warm affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair.  YOU wish to think all\\r\\nthe world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I\\r\\nonly want to think YOU perfect, and you set yourself against it.\\r\\nDo not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my\\r\\nencroaching on your privilege of universal good-will.  You need\\r\\nnot.  There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of\\r\\nwhom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I\\r\\ndissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the\\r\\ninconsistency of all human characters, and of the little\\r\\ndependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\r\\nsense.  I have met with two instances lately, one I will not\\r\\nmention; the other is Charlotte\\'s marriage.  It is unaccountable!\\r\\nIn every view it is unaccountable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.  They\\r\\nwill ruin your happiness.  You do not make allowance enough\\r\\nfor difference of situation and temper.  Consider Mr. Collins\\'s\\r\\nrespectability, and Charlotte\\'s steady, prudent character.\\r\\nRemember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it\\r\\nis a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\\'s\\r\\nsake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our\\r\\ncousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no\\r\\none else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I\\r\\npersuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only\\r\\nthink worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.\\r\\nMy dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-\\r\\nminded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must\\r\\nfeel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot\\r\\nhave a proper way of thinking.  You shall not defend her, though\\r\\nit is Charlotte Lucas.  You shall not, for the sake of one\\r\\nindividual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor\\r\\nendeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is\\r\\nprudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I musty think your language too strong in speaking of both,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing\\r\\nthem happy together.  But enough of this.  You alluded to\\r\\nsomething else.  You mentioned TWO instances.  I cannot\\r\\nmisunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me\\r\\nby thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your opinion\\r\\nof him is sunk.  We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves\\r\\nintentionally injured.  We must not expect a lively young man to\\r\\nbe always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing\\r\\nbut our own vanity that deceives us.  Women fancy admiration\\r\\nmeans more than it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no\\r\\nidea of there being so much design in the world as some persons\\r\\nimagine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to\\r\\ndesign,\" said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or\\r\\nto make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be\\r\\nmisery.  Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people\\'s\\r\\nfeelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; to the last.  But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying\\r\\nwhat I think of persons you esteem Stop me whilst you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot believe it.  Why should they try to influence him?\\r\\nThey can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no\\r\\nother woman can secure it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your first position is false.  They may wish many things besides\\r\\nhis happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and\\r\\nconsequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the\\r\\nimportance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings than you are\\r\\nsupposing.  They have known her much longer than they have\\r\\nknown me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever\\r\\nmay be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have\\r\\nopposed their brother\\'s.  What sister would think herself at\\r\\nliberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?\\r\\nIf they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part\\r\\nus; if he were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such an\\r\\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong,\\r\\nand me most unhappy.  Do not distress me by the idea.  I am not\\r\\nashamed of having been mistaken-- or, at least, it is light, it is\\r\\nnothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him\\r\\nor his sisters.  Let me take it in the best light, in the light in\\r\\nwhich it may be understood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\\r\\nBingley\\'s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\\r\\nno more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did\\r\\nnot account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever\\r\\nconsidering it with less perplexity.  Her daughter endeavoured to\\r\\nconvince her of what she did not believe herself, that his\\r\\nattentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and\\r\\ntransient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but\\r\\nthough the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,\\r\\nshe had the same story to repeat every day.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s best\\r\\ncomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the\\r\\nsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently.  \"So, Lizzy,\" said he\\r\\none day, \"your sister is crossed in love, I find.  I congratulate\\r\\nher.  Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in\\r\\nlove now and then.  It is something to think of, and it gives her a\\r\\nsort of distinction among her companions.  When is your turn to\\r\\ncome?  You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now is\\r\\nyour time.  Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all\\r\\nthe young ladies in the country.  Let Wickham be your man.  He\\r\\nis a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.  We\\r\\nmust not all expect Jane\\'s good fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that\\r\\nwhatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate\\r\\nmother who will make the most of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s society was of material service in dispelling the\\r\\ngloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many\\r\\nof the Longbourn family.  They saw him often, and to his other\\r\\nrecommendations was now added that of general unreserve.\\r\\nThe whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on\\r\\nMr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now\\r\\nopenly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody\\r\\nwas pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr.\\r\\nDarcy before they had known anything of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there\\r\\nmight be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to\\r\\nthe society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always\\r\\npleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--\\r\\nbut by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 25\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\\r\\nMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival\\r\\nof Saturday.  The pain of separation, however, might be\\r\\nalleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his\\r\\nbride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into\\r\\nHertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.  He took leave of his relations at Longbourn\\r\\nwith as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health\\r\\nand happiness again, and promised their father another letter of\\r\\nthanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\\r\\nreceiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend\\r\\nthe Christmas at Longbourn.  Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by\\r\\nnature as education.  The Netherfield ladies would have had\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within\\r\\nview of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and\\r\\nagreeable.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent,\\r\\nelegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn\\r\\nnieces.  Between the two eldest and herself especially, there\\r\\nsubsisted a particular regard.  They had frequently been staying\\r\\nwith her in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s business on her arrival was to\\r\\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.  When\\r\\nthis was done she had a less active part to play.  It became her\\r\\nturn to listen.  Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and\\r\\nmuch to complain of.  They had all been very ill-used since she\\r\\nlast saw her sister.  Two of her girls had been upon the point of\\r\\nmarriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got\\r\\nMr. Bingley if she could.  But Lizzy!  Oh, sister!  It is very hard\\r\\nto think that she might have been Mr. Collins\\'s wife by this time,\\r\\nhad it not been for her own perverseness.  He made her an offer\\r\\nin this very room, and she refused him.  The consequence of it is,\\r\\nthat Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and\\r\\nthat the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.  The\\r\\nLucases are very artful people indeed, sister.  They are all for\\r\\nwhat they can get.  I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.  It\\r\\nmakes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own\\r\\nfamily, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before\\r\\nanybody else.  However, your coming just at this time is the\\r\\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us,\\r\\nof long sleeves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given\\r\\nbefore, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\'s correspondence\\r\\nwith her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to\\r\\nher nieces, turned the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the\\r\\nsubject.  \"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for\\r\\nJane,\" said she.  \"I am sorry it went off.  But these things happen\\r\\nso often!  A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so\\r\\neasily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when\\r\\naccident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of\\r\\ninconsistencies are very frequent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will\\r\\nnot do for US.  We do not suffer by accident.  It does not often\\r\\nhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young\\r\\nman of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he\\r\\nwas violently in love with only a few days before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so\\r\\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.  It is as\\r\\noften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\\'s\\r\\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.  Pray, how\\r\\nVIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley\\'s love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\r\\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.  Every\\r\\ntime they met, it was more decided and remarkable.  At his own\\r\\nball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them\\r\\nto dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an\\r\\nanswer. Could there be finer symptoms?  Is not general incivility\\r\\nthe very essence of love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\\r\\nPoor Jane!  I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she\\r\\nmay not get over it immediately.  It had better have happened to\\r\\nYOU, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\\r\\nBut do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with\\r\\nus?  Change of scene might be of service-- and perhaps a little\\r\\nrelief from home may be as useful as anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt\\r\\npersuaded of her sister\\'s ready acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with\\r\\nregard to this young man will influence her.  We live in so\\r\\ndifferent a part of town, all our connections are so different, and,\\r\\nas you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable\\r\\nthat they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And THAT is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of\\r\\nhis friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on\\r\\nJane in such a part of London!  My dear aunt, how could you\\r\\nthink of it?  Mr. Darcy may perhaps have HEARD of such a\\r\\nplace as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a\\r\\nmonth\\'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were\\r\\nhe once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs\\r\\nwithout him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  I hope they will not meet at all.  But does\\r\\nnot Jane correspond with his sister?  SHE will not be able to\\r\\nhelp calling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place\\r\\nthis point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\\'s\\r\\nbeing withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the\\r\\nsubject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not\\r\\nconsider it entirely hopeless.  It was possible, and sometimes she\\r\\nthought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and\\r\\nthe influence of his friends successfully combated by the more\\r\\nnatural influence of Jane\\'s attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\\'s invitation with pleasure; and\\r\\nthe Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time,\\r\\nthan as she hoped by Caroline\\'s not living in the same house\\r\\nwith her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with\\r\\nher, without any danger of seeing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the\\r\\nPhillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day\\r\\nwithout its engagement.  Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided\\r\\nfor the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not\\r\\nonce sit down to a family dinner.  When the engagement was for\\r\\nhome, some of the officers always made part of it-- of which\\r\\nofficers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these\\r\\noccasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nwarm commendation, narrowly observed them both.  Without\\r\\nsupposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love,\\r\\ntheir preference of each other was plain enough to make her a\\r\\nlittle uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the\\r\\nsubject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the\\r\\nimprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording\\r\\npleasure, unconnected with his general powers.  About ten or a\\r\\ndozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a\\r\\nconsiderable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he\\r\\nbelonged.  They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common;\\r\\nand though Wickham had been little there since the death of\\r\\nDarcy\\'s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\\r\\nintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\\r\\nprocuring.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberly, and known the late Mr. Darcy\\r\\nby character perfectly well.  Here consequently was an\\r\\ninexhaustible subject of discourse.  In comparing her recollection\\r\\nof Pemberly with the minute description which Wickham could\\r\\ngive, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of\\r\\nits late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.  On\\r\\nbeing made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\\'s treatment\\r\\nof him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\\'s reputed\\r\\ndisposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was\\r\\nconfident at last that she recollected having heard Mr.\\r\\nFitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured\\r\\nboy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 26\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner\\'s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly\\r\\ngiven on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her\\r\\nalone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\\r\\nyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of\\r\\nspeaking openly.  Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.\\r\\nDo not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an\\r\\naffection which the want of fortune would make so very\\r\\nimprudent.  I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a most\\r\\ninteresting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to\\r\\nhave, I should think you could not do better.  But as it is, you\\r\\nmust not let your fancy run away with you.  You have sense, and\\r\\nwe all expect you to use it.  Your father would depend on\\r\\nYOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure.  You must not\\r\\ndisappoint your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.  I will take care of\\r\\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too.  He shall not be in love with\\r\\nme, if I can prevent it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again.  At present I am not in love\\r\\nwith Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.  But he is, beyond all\\r\\ncomparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw-- and if he\\r\\nbecomes really attached to me-- I believe it will be better that he\\r\\nshould not.  I see the imprudence of it.  Oh! THAT abominable\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  My father\\'s opinion of me does me the greatest\\r\\nhonour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it.  My father,\\r\\nhowever, is partial to Mr. Wickham.  In short, my dear aunt, I\\r\\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you\\r\\nunhappy; but since we see every day that where there is\\r\\naffection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want\\r\\nof fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how\\r\\ncan I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if\\r\\nI am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be\\r\\nwisdom  to resist?  All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\\r\\nto be in a hurry.  I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\\r\\nobject.  When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.\\r\\nIn short, I will do my best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so\\r\\nvery often.  At least, you should not REMIND you mother of\\r\\ninviting him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:\\r\\n\"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT.  But do\\r\\nnot imagine that he is always here so often.  It is on your\\r\\naccount that he has been so frequently invited this week.  You\\r\\nknow my mother\\'s ideas as to the necessity of constant company\\r\\nfor her friends.  But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do\\r\\nwhat I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked\\r\\nher for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful\\r\\ninstance of advice being given on such a point, without being\\r\\nresented.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been\\r\\nquitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode\\r\\nwith the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.\\r\\nBennet.  His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at\\r\\nlength so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even\\r\\nrepeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she \"WISHED they\\r\\nmight be happy.\"  Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on\\r\\nWednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she\\r\\nrose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\'s\\r\\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected\\r\\nherself, accompanied her out of the room.  As they went\\r\\ndownstairs together, Charlotte said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT you certainly shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I have another favour to ask you.  Will you come and see\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.  Promise me,\\r\\ntherefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in\\r\\nthe visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added\\r\\nCharlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.\\r\\nIndeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding took place:  the bride and bridegroom set off for\\r\\nKent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say,\\r\\nor to hear, on the subject as usual.  Elizabeth soon heard from\\r\\nher friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent\\r\\nas it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was\\r\\nimpossible.  Elizabeth could never address her without feeling\\r\\nthat all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined\\r\\nnot to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what\\r\\nhad been, rather than what was.  Charlotte\\'s first letters were\\r\\nreceived with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\r\\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how\\r\\nshe would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare\\r\\npronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read,\\r\\nElizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point\\r\\nexactly as she might have foreseen.  She wrote cheerfully,\\r\\nseemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which\\r\\nshe could not praise.  The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\r\\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\\'s behaviour was\\r\\nmost friendly and obliging.  It was Mr. Collins\\'s picture of\\r\\nHunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth\\r\\nperceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the\\r\\nrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce\\r\\ntheir safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth\\r\\nhoped it would be in her power to say something of the\\r\\nBingleys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as\\r\\nimpatience generally is.  Jane had been a week in town without\\r\\neither seeing or hearing from Caroline.  She accounted for it,\\r\\nhowever, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from\\r\\nLongbourn had by some accident been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of\\r\\nthe town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss\\r\\nBingley.  \"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words,\\r\\n\"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving\\r\\nher no notice of my coming to London.  I was right, therefore,\\r\\nmy last letter had never reached her.  I inquired after their\\r\\nbrother, of course.  He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.\\r\\nDarcy that they scarcely ever saw him.  I found that Miss Darcy\\r\\nwas expected to dinner.  I wish I could see her.  My visit was\\r\\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.  I dare say\\r\\nI shall see them soon here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter.  It convinced her that\\r\\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\\'s being in\\r\\ntown.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.  She\\r\\nendeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but\\r\\nshe could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\\'s inattention.  After\\r\\nwaiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing\\r\\nevery evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last\\r\\nappear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration\\r\\nof her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.\\r\\nThe letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\\r\\nprove what she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\r\\nher better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to\\r\\nhave been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\'s regard for me.\\r\\nBut, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do\\r\\nnot think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her\\r\\nbehaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.\\r\\nI do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate\\r\\nwith me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I\\r\\nam sure I should be deceived again.  Caroline did not return my\\r\\nvisit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the\\r\\nmeantime.  When she did come, it was very evident that she had\\r\\nno pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\r\\ncalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and\\r\\nwas in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went\\r\\naway I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no\\r\\nlonger.  I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.  She was very\\r\\nwrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every\\r\\nadvance to intimacy began on her side.  But I pity her, because\\r\\nshe must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\\r\\nvery sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.  I need\\r\\nnot explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety to\\r\\nbe quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her\\r\\nbehaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister,\\r\\nwhatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\\r\\namiable.  I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such\\r\\nfears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must\\r\\nhave met, long ago.  He knows of my being in town, I am\\r\\ncertain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem,\\r\\nby her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself\\r\\nthat he is really partial to Miss Darcy.  I cannot understand it.  If\\r\\nI were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted\\r\\nto say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.\\r\\nBut I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think\\r\\nonly of what will make me happy-- your affection, and the\\r\\ninvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.  Let me hear from\\r\\nyou very soon.  Miss Bingley said something of his never\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\\r\\nwith any certainty.  We had better not mention it.  I am\\r\\nextremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our\\r\\nfriends at Hunsford.  Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\\r\\nMaria.  I am sure you will be very comfortable there.-- Yours,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as\\r\\nshe considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister\\r\\nat least.  All expectation from the brother was now absolutely\\r\\nover.  She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\\r\\nHis character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for\\r\\nhim, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped\\r\\nhe might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\\'s sister, as by Wickham\\'s\\r\\naccount, she would make him abundantly regret what he had\\r\\nthrown away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\r\\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and\\r\\nElizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to\\r\\nher aunt than to herself.  His apparent partiality had subsided, his\\r\\nattentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\\r\\nElizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it\\r\\nand write of it without material pain.  Her heart had been but\\r\\nslightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that\\r\\nSHE would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.\\r\\nThe sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the\\r\\nmost remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now\\r\\nrendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted\\r\\nperhaps in this case than in Charlotte\\'s, did not quarrel with him\\r\\nfor his wish of independence.  Nothing, on the contrary, could\\r\\nbe more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few\\r\\nstruggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and\\r\\ndesirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\\r\\nhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating\\r\\nthe circumstances, she thus went on:-- \"I am now convinced, my\\r\\ndear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really\\r\\nexperiences that pure and elevating passion, I should at present\\r\\ndetest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.  But my\\r\\nfeelings are not only cordial towards HIM; they are even\\r\\nimpartial towards Miss King.  I cannot find out that I hate her at\\r\\nall, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good\\r\\nsort of girl.  There can be no love in all this.  My watchfulness\\r\\nhas been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\r\\ninteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in\\r\\nlove with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative\\r\\ninsignificance.  Importance may sometimes be purchased too\\r\\ndearly.  Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart\\r\\nthan I do.  They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet\\r\\nopen to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men\\r\\nmust have something to live on as well as the plain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 27\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and\\r\\notherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,\\r\\nsometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February\\r\\npass away.  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.  She had\\r\\nnot at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte,\\r\\nshe soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually\\r\\nlearned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as\\r\\ngreater certainty.  Absence had increased her desire of seeing\\r\\nCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.  There\\r\\nwas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\r\\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little\\r\\nchange was not unwelcome for its own sake.  The journey\\r\\nwould moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the\\r\\ntime drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.\\r\\nEverything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled\\r\\naccording to Charlotte\\'s first sketch.  She was to accompany Sir\\r\\nWilliam and his second daughter.  The improvement of spending\\r\\na night in London was added in time, and the plan became\\r\\nperfect as plan could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly\\r\\nmiss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her\\r\\ngoing, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to\\r\\nanswer her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly\\r\\nfriendly; on his side even more.  His present pursuit could not\\r\\nmake him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to\\r\\ndeserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be\\r\\nadmired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her\\r\\nevery enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--\\r\\ntheir opinion of everybody-- would always coincide, there was a\\r\\nsolicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him\\r\\nwith a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced\\r\\nthat, whether married or single, he must always be her model of\\r\\nthe amiable and pleasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\r\\nthink him less agreeable.  Sir William Lucas, and his daughter\\r\\nMaria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself,\\r\\nhad nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were\\r\\nlistened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.\\r\\nElizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William\\'s too\\r\\nlong.  He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his\\r\\npresentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out,\\r\\nlike his information.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so\\r\\nearly as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.  As they drove to\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window\\r\\nwatching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was\\r\\nthere to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her\\r\\nface, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.  On the\\r\\nstairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for\\r\\ntheir cousin\\'s appearance would not allow them to wait in the\\r\\ndrawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for\\r\\na twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.  All was joy and\\r\\nkindness.  The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in\\r\\nbustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.  Their first object was\\r\\nher sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in\\r\\nreply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled\\r\\nto support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.  It was\\r\\nreasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley\\'s\\r\\nvisit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations\\r\\noccurring at different times between Jane and herself, which\\r\\nproved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on  Wickham\\'s desertion,\\r\\nand complimented her on bearing it so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss\\r\\nKing?  I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\\r\\naffairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?  Where\\r\\ndoes discretion end, and avarice begin?  Last Christmas you\\r\\nwere afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent;\\r\\nand now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten\\r\\nthousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall\\r\\nknow what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.  I know no harm of\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\\'s\\r\\ndeath made her mistress of this fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- what should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain\\r\\nMY affections because I had no money, what occasion could\\r\\nthere be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about,\\r\\nand who was equally poor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\\r\\ntowards her so soon after this event.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those\\r\\nelegant decorums which other people may observe.  If SHE does\\r\\nnot object to it, why should WE?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HER not objecting does not justify HIM.  It only shows her\\r\\nbeing deficient in something herself-- sense or feeling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose.  HE shall be\\r\\nmercenary, and SHE shall be foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do NOT choose.  I should be sorry,\\r\\nyou know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in\\r\\nDerbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who\\r\\nlive in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\\r\\nHertfordshire are not much better.  I am sick of them all.  Thank\\r\\nHeaven!  I am going tomorrow where I shall find a man who has\\r\\nnot one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to\\r\\nrecommend him.  Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing,\\r\\nafter all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\\r\\ndisappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she\\r\\nhad the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her\\r\\nuncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking\\r\\nin the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, \"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and\\r\\nher acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear, dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight!\\r\\nwhat felicity!  You give me fresh life and vigour.  Adieu to\\r\\ndisappointment and spleen.  What are young men to rocks and\\r\\nmountains?  Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend!  And\\r\\nwhen we DO return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\r\\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything.  We WILL\\r\\nknow where we have gone-- we WILL recollect what we have\\r\\nseen.  Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together\\r\\nin our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any\\r\\nparticular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative\\r\\nsituation.  Let OUR first effusions be less insupportable than\\r\\nthose of the generality of travellers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 28\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery object in the next day\\'s journey was new and interesting\\r\\nto Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she\\r\\nhad seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her\\r\\nhealth, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant\\r\\nsource of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye\\r\\nwas in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to\\r\\nbring it in view.  The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary\\r\\non one side.  Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she\\r\\nhad heard of its inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible.  The garden sloping to\\r\\nthe road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel\\r\\nhedge, everything declared they were arriving.  Mr. Collins and\\r\\nCharlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the\\r\\nsmall gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst\\r\\nthe nods and smiles of the whole party.  In a moment they were\\r\\nall out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.  Mrs.\\r\\nCollins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and\\r\\nElizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she\\r\\nfound herself so affectionately received.  She saw instantly that\\r\\nher cousin\\'s manner were not altered by his marriage; his formal\\r\\ncivility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\r\\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all\\r\\nher family.  They were then, with no other delay than his\\r\\npointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house;\\r\\nand as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a\\r\\nsecond time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode,\\r\\nand punctually repeated all his wife\\'s offers of refreshment.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not\\r\\nhelp in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the\\r\\nroom, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself\\r\\nparticularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had\\r\\nlost in refusing him.  But though everything seemed neat and\\r\\ncomfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of\\r\\nrepentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she\\r\\ncould have so cheerful an air with such a companion.  When\\r\\nMr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\r\\nashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily\\r\\nturned her eye on Charlotte.  Once of twice she could discern a\\r\\nfaint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.  After\\r\\nsitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the\\r\\nroom, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of\\r\\ntheir journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.\\r\\nCollins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was\\r\\nlarge and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he\\r\\nattended himself.  To work in this garden was one of his most\\r\\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\\r\\ncountenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of\\r\\nthe exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\\r\\nHere, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and\\r\\nscarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked\\r\\nfor, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\\r\\nbeauty entirely behind.  He could number the fields in every\\r\\ndirection, and could tell how many tress there were in the most\\r\\ndistant clump.  But of all the views which his garden, or which\\r\\nthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared\\r\\nwith the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees\\r\\nthat bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.  It\\r\\nwas a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two\\r\\nmeadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the\\r\\nremains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William\\r\\naccompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the\\r\\nhouse, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity\\r\\nof showing it without her husband\\'s help.  It was rather small,\\r\\nbut well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and\\r\\narranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth\\r\\ngave Charlotte all the credit.  When Mr. Collins could be\\r\\nforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout,\\r\\nand by Charlotte\\'s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed\\r\\nhe must be often forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the\\r\\ncountry.  It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when\\r\\nMr. Collins joining in, observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I\\r\\nneed not say you will be delighted with her.  She is all affability\\r\\nand condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured\\r\\nwith some portion of her notice when service is over.  I have\\r\\nscarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my\\r\\nsister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during\\r\\nyour stay here.  Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.\\r\\nWe dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\\r\\nwalk home.  Her ladyship\\'s carriage is regularly ordered for us.\\r\\nI SHOULD say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has\\r\\nseveral.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\\r\\nadded Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.  She is the sort of\\r\\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening was  spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire\\r\\nnews, and telling again what had already been written; and when\\r\\nit closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to\\r\\nmeditate upon Charlotte\\'s degree of contentment, to understand\\r\\nher address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her\\r\\nhusband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.  She\\r\\nhad also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor\\r\\nof their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.  A\\r\\nlively imagination soon settled it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting\\r\\nready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the\\r\\nwhole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she\\r\\nheard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling\\r\\nloudly after her.  She opened the door and met Maria in the\\r\\nlanding place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\\r\\ndining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!  I will not tell\\r\\nyou what it is.  Make haste, and come down this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing\\r\\nmore, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted\\r\\nthe lane, in quest of this wonder!  It was two ladies stopping in a\\r\\nlow phaeton at the garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I expected at least that the\\r\\npigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady\\r\\nCatherine and her daughter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is\\r\\nnot Lady Catherine.  The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives\\r\\nwith them; the other is Miss de Bourgh.  Only look at her.  She\\r\\nis quite a little creature.  Who would have thought that she could\\r\\nbe so thin and small?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this\\r\\nwind.  Why does she not come in?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.  It is the greatest of\\r\\nfavours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\\r\\n\"She looks sickly and cross.  Yes, she will do for him very well.\\r\\nShe will make him a very proper wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\\r\\nconversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\'s high\\r\\ndiversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest\\r\\ncontemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly\\r\\nbowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,\\r\\nand the others returned into the house.  Mr. Collins no sooner\\r\\nsaw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their\\r\\ngood fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know\\r\\nthat the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 29\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was\\r\\ncomplete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness\\r\\nto his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility\\r\\ntowards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished\\r\\nfor; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon,\\r\\nwas such an instance of Lady Catherine\\'s condescension, as he\\r\\nknew not how to admire enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised\\r\\nby her ladyship\\'s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the\\r\\nevening at Rosings.  I rather expected, from my knowledge of\\r\\nher affability, that it would happen.  But who could have\\r\\nforeseen such an attention as this?  Who could have imagined\\r\\nthat we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation,\\r\\nmoreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your\\r\\narrival!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir\\r\\nWilliam, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great\\r\\nreally are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\\r\\nAbout the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not\\r\\nuncommon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning\\r\\nbut their visit to Rosings.  Mr. Collins was carefully instructing\\r\\nthem in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,\\r\\nso many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly\\r\\noverpower them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette. Her said to\\r\\nElizabeth--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your\\r\\napparel.  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of\\r\\ndress in us which becomes herself and her daughter.  I would\\r\\nadvise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior\\r\\nto the rest-- there is no occasion for anything more.  Lady\\r\\nCatherine will not think the worse of you for being simply\\r\\ndressed.  She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their\\r\\ndifferent doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\\r\\nSuch formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of\\r\\nliving, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to\\r\\ncompany, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings\\r\\nwith as much apprehension as her father had done to his\\r\\npresentation at St. James\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\r\\nmile across the park.  Every park has its beauty and its\\r\\nprospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though\\r\\nshe could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the\\r\\nscene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration\\r\\nof the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the\\r\\nglazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\'s alarm was\\r\\nevery moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look\\r\\nperfectly calm.  Elizabeth\\'s courage did not fail her.  She had\\r\\nheard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any\\r\\nextraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere\\r\\nstateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness\\r\\nwithout trepidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\r\\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,\\r\\nthey followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room\\r\\nwhere Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were\\r\\nsitting.  Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive\\r\\nthem; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the\\r\\noffice of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a\\r\\nproper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which\\r\\nhe would have thought necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of having been at St. James\\'s Sir William was so\\r\\ncompletely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had\\r\\nbut just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his\\r\\nseat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost\\r\\nout of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing\\r\\nwhich way to look.  Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the\\r\\nscene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.\\r\\nLady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\r\\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome.  Her air was\\r\\nnot conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as\\r\\nto make her visitors forget their inferior rank.  She was not\\r\\nrendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was\\r\\nspoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance,\\r\\nand brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and\\r\\nfrom the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady\\r\\nCatherine to be exactly what he represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and\\r\\ndeportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nshe turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have\\r\\njoined in Maria\\'s astonishment at her being so thin and so small.\\r\\nThere was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the\\r\\nladies.  Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though\\r\\nnot plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in\\r\\na low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was\\r\\nnothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to\\r\\nwhat she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\r\\nher eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the\\r\\nwindows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to\\r\\npoint out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them\\r\\nthat it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the\\r\\nservants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had\\r\\npromised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at\\r\\nthe bottom of the table, by her ladyship\\'s desire, and looked as if\\r\\nhe felt that life could furnish nothing greater.  He carved, and\\r\\nate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\\r\\ncommended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\\r\\nenough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\r\\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\\r\\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive\\r\\nadmiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any\\r\\ndish on the table proved a novelty to them.  The party did not\\r\\nsupply much conversation.  Elizabeth was ready to speak\\r\\nwhenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\\r\\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh-- the former of whom was\\r\\nengaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a\\r\\nword to her all dinner-time.  Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly\\r\\nemployed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing\\r\\nher to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.\\r\\nMaria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen\\r\\ndid nothing but eat and admire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little\\r\\nto be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did\\r\\nwithout any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her\\r\\nopinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that\\r\\nshe was not used to have her judgement controverted.  She\\r\\ninquired into Charlotte\\'s domestic concerns familiarly and\\r\\nminutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management\\r\\nof them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so\\r\\nsmall a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her\\r\\ncows and her poultry.  Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath\\r\\nthis great lady\\'s attention, which could furnish her with an\\r\\noccasion of dictating to others.  In the intervals of her discourse\\r\\nwith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria\\r\\nand Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections\\r\\nshe knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a\\r\\nvery genteel, pretty kind of girl.  She asked her, at different\\r\\ntimes, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or\\r\\nyounger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be\\r\\nmarried, whether they were handsome, where they had been\\r\\neducated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\\r\\nmother\\'s maiden name?  Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\\r\\nquestions but answered them very composedly.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nthen observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.  For\\r\\nyour sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I\\r\\nsee no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.  It was\\r\\nnot thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\'s family.  Do you\\r\\nplay and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! then-- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.\\r\\nOur instrument is a capital one, probably superior to---- You\\r\\nshall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of them does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did not you all learn?  You ought all to have learned.  The\\r\\nMiss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income\\r\\nas yours.  Do you draw?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very strange.  But I suppose you had no opportunity.\\r\\nYour mother should have taken you to town every spring for the\\r\\nbenefit of masters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates\\r\\nLondon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No governess!  How was that possible? Five daughters brought\\r\\nup at home without a governess!  I never heard of such a thing.\\r\\nYour mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had\\r\\nnot been the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, who taught you?  who attended to you?  Without a\\r\\ngoverness, you must have been neglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us\\r\\nas wished to learn never wanted the means.  We were always\\r\\nencouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\\r\\nThose who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if\\r\\nI had known your mother, I should have advised her most\\r\\nstrenuously to engage one.  I always say that nothing is to be\\r\\ndone in education without steady and regular instruction, and\\r\\nnobody but a governess can give it.  It is wonderful how many\\r\\nfamilies I have been the means of supplying in that way.  I am\\r\\nalways glad to get a young person well placed out.  Four nieces\\r\\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my\\r\\nmeans; and it was but the other day that I recommended another\\r\\nyoung person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me,\\r\\nand the family are quite delighted with her.  Mrs. Collins, did I\\r\\ntell you of Lady Metcalf\\'s calling yesterday to thank me?  She\\r\\nfinds Miss Pope a treasure.  \\'Lady Catherine,\\' said she, \\'you\\r\\nhave given me a treasure.\\'  Are any of your younger sisters out,\\r\\nMiss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All!  What, all five out at once?  Very odd!  And you only the\\r\\nsecond.  The younger ones out before the elder ones are\\r\\nmarried!  Your younger sisters must be very young?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.  Perhaps SHE is full young to\\r\\nbe much in company.  But really, ma\\'am, I think it would be\\r\\nvery hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their\\r\\nshare of society and amusement, because the elder may not have\\r\\nthe means or inclination to marry early.  The last-born has as\\r\\ngood a right to the pleasures of youth at the first.  And to be\\r\\nkept back on SUCH a motive!  I think it would not be very likely\\r\\nto promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very\\r\\ndecidedly for so young a person.  Pray, what is your age?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nsmiling, \"your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\\r\\nanswer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature\\r\\nwho had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified\\r\\nimpertinence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need\\r\\nnot conceal your age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the\\r\\ncard-tables were placed.  Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nchose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of\\r\\nassisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.  Their table was\\r\\nsuperlatively stupid.  Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not\\r\\nrelate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her\\r\\nfears of Miss de Bourgh\\'s being too hot or too cold, or having\\r\\ntoo much or too little light.  A great deal more passed at the\\r\\nother table.  Lady Catherine was generally speaking-- stating the\\r\\nmistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\\r\\nherself.  Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her\\r\\nladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and\\r\\napologising if he thought he won too many.  Sir William did not\\r\\nsay much.  He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble\\r\\nnames.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as\\r\\nthey chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered.\\r\\nThe party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine\\r\\ndetermine what weather they were to have on the morrow.\\r\\nFrom these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of\\r\\nthe coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s side and as many bows on Sir William\\'s they departed.\\r\\nAs soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called\\r\\non by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at\\r\\nRosings, which, for Charlotte\\'s sake, she made more favourable\\r\\nthan it really was.  But her commendation, though costing her\\r\\nsome trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was\\r\\nvery soon obliged to take her ladyship\\'s praise into his own\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 30\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was\\r\\nlong enough to convince him of his daughter\\'s being most\\r\\ncomfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\\r\\nsuch a neighbour as were not often met with.  While Sir William\\r\\nwas with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him\\r\\nout in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went\\r\\naway, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\\r\\nElizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\r\\ncousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between\\r\\nbreakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in\\r\\nthe garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the\\r\\nwindow in his own book-room, which fronted the road.  The\\r\\nroom in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at\\r\\nfirst rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the\\r\\ndining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and\\r\\nhad a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had\\r\\nan excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would\\r\\nundoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they\\r\\nsat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the\\r\\narrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the\\r\\nlane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of\\r\\nwhat carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de\\r\\nBourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming\\r\\nto inform them of, though it happened almost every day.  She\\r\\nnot unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\r\\nprevailed upon to get out.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\\r\\nRosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\\r\\nnecessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there\\r\\nmight be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not\\r\\nunderstand the sacrifice of so many hours.  Now and then they\\r\\nwere honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing\\r\\nescaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\r\\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at\\r\\ntheir work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault\\r\\nwith the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid\\r\\nin negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do\\r\\nit only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\\'s joints of\\r\\n\\r\\neat were too large for her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\r\\ncommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active\\r\\nmagistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which\\r\\nwere carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the\\r\\ncottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too\\r\\npoor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,\\r\\nsilence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and\\r\\nplenty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice\\r\\na week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being\\r\\nonly one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was\\r\\nthe counterpart of the first.  Their other engagements were few,\\r\\nas the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s reach.  This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth,\\r\\nand upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough;\\r\\nthere were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte,\\r\\nand the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\\r\\noften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and\\r\\nwhere she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady\\r\\nCatherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of\\r\\nthe park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one\\r\\nseemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed\\r\\naway.  Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was\\r\\nto bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a\\r\\ncircle must be important.  Elizabeth had heard soon after her\\r\\narrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few\\r\\nweeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances\\r\\nwhom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one\\r\\ncomparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she\\r\\nmight be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\'s designs\\r\\non him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was\\r\\nevidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming\\r\\nwith the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the\\r\\nhighest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had\\r\\nalready been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas walking the whole morning within view of the lodges\\r\\nopening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest\\r\\n\\r\\nassurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned\\r\\ninto the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.  On the\\r\\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.\\r\\nThere were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\\r\\nMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the\\r\\nyounger son of his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of\\r\\nall the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentleman\\r\\naccompanied him.  Charlotte had seen them from her husband\\'s\\r\\nroom, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other,\\r\\ntold the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nwould never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the\\r\\ncompliment, before their approach was announced by the\\r\\ndoor-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered\\r\\nthe room.  Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about\\r\\nthirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the\\r\\ngentleman . Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look\\r\\nin Hertfordshire-- paid his compliments, with his usual reserve,\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\r\\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth\\r\\nmerely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\r\\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very\\r\\npleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight\\r\\nobservation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for\\r\\nsome time without speaking to anybody.  At length, however,\\r\\nhis civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after\\r\\nthe health of her family.  She answered him in the usual way,\\r\\nand after a moment\\'s pause, added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.  Have\\r\\nyou never happened to see her there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to\\r\\nsee whether he would betray any consciousness of what had\\r\\npassed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he\\r\\nlooked a little confused as he answered that he had never been\\r\\nso fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.  The subject was pursued\\r\\nno farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 31\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners were very much admired at the\\r\\nParsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably\\r\\nto the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.  It was some\\r\\ndays, however, before they received any invitation thither-- for\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile there were visitors in the house, they could not be\\r\\nnecessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the\\r\\ngentlemen\\'s arrival, that they were honoured by such an\\r\\nattention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\r\\ncome there in the evening.  For the last week they had seen very\\r\\nlittle of Lady Catherine or her daughter.  Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\r\\ncalled at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\\r\\nDarcy they had seen only at church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they\\r\\njoined the party in Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-room.  Her ladyship\\r\\nreceived them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by\\r\\nno means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and\\r\\nshe was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to\\r\\nthem, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person\\r\\nin the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything\\r\\nwas a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\\'s\\r\\npretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.  He now\\r\\nseated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and\\r\\nHertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books\\r\\nand music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained\\r\\nin that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and\\r\\nflow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well\\r\\nas of Mr. Darcy.  HIS eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\r\\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,\\r\\nafter a while, shared the feeling, was more openly\\r\\nacknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?  What is it you are\\r\\ntalking of?  What are you telling Miss Bennet?  Let me hear\\r\\nwhat it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no longer\\r\\nable to avoid a reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of music!  Then pray speak aloud.  It is of all subjects my\\r\\n\\r\\ndelight.  I must have my share in the conversation if you are\\r\\nspeaking of music.  There are few people in England, I suppose,\\r\\nwho have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better\\r\\nnatural taste.  If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great\\r\\nproficient.  And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to\\r\\napply.  I am confident that she would have performed\\r\\ndelightfully.  How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\'s\\r\\nproficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\\r\\nCatherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to\\r\\nexcel if she does not practice a good deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such\\r\\nadvice.  She practises very constantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  It cannot be done too much; and when I\\r\\nnext write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\\r\\naccount.  I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is\\r\\nto be acquired without constant practice.  I have told Miss\\r\\nBennet several times, that she will never play really well unless\\r\\nshe practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument,\\r\\nshe is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to\\r\\nRosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\r\\nJenkinson\\'s room.  She would be in nobody\\'s way, you know, in\\r\\nthat part of the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\'s ill-breeding, and\\r\\nmade no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth\\r\\nof having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to\\r\\nthe instrument.  He drew a chair near her.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nlistened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other\\r\\nnephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with\\r\\nhis usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so\\r\\nas to command a full view of the fair performer\\'s countenance.\\r\\nElizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient\\r\\npause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state\\r\\nto hear me?  I will not be alarmed though your sister DOES play\\r\\nso well.  There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to\\r\\n\\r\\nbe frightened at the will of others.  My courage always rises at\\r\\nevery attempt to intimidate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you\\r\\ncould not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming\\r\\nyou; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long\\r\\nenough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally\\r\\nprofessing opinions which in fact are not your own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty\\r\\nnotion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.  I am\\r\\nparticularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose\\r\\nmy real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to\\r\\npass myself off with some degree of credit.  Indeed, Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nit is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my\\r\\ndisadvantage in Hertfordshire-- and, give me leave to say, very\\r\\nimpolitic too-- for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things\\r\\nmay come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam.  \"I should like to know how he behaves\\r\\namong strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall hear then-- but prepare yourself for something very\\r\\ndreadful.  The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nyou must know, was at a ball-- and at this ball, what do you\\r\\nthink he did?  He danced only four dances, though gentlemen\\r\\nwere scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one\\r\\nyoung lady was sitting down in want of a partner.  Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nyou cannot deny the fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the\\r\\nassembly beyond my own party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.  Well,\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?  My fingers wait your\\r\\norders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I\\r\\nsought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend\\r\\nmyself to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\nstill addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.  \"Shall we ask him why a\\r\\nman of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill\\r\\nqualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without\\r\\napplying to him.  It is because he will not give himself the\\r\\ntrouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in\\r\\ntheir concerns, as I often see done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument\\r\\nin the masterly manner which I see so many women\\'s do.  They\\r\\nhave not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the\\r\\nsame expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my\\r\\nown fault-- because I will not take the trouble of practising.  It is\\r\\nnot that I do not believe MY fingers as capable as any other\\r\\nwoman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right.  You have\\r\\nemployed your time much better.  No one admitted to the\\r\\nprivilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.  We neither\\r\\nof us perform to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to\\r\\nknow what they were talking of.  Elizabeth immediately began\\r\\nplaying again.  Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening\\r\\nfor a few minutes, said to Darcy:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,\\r\\nand could have the advantage of a London master.  She has a\\r\\nvery good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to\\r\\nAnne\\'s.  Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her\\r\\nhealth allowed her to learn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other\\r\\ncould she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of\\r\\nhis behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for\\r\\nMiss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry\\r\\nHER, had she been his relation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nperformance, mixing with them many instructions on execution\\r\\nand taste.  Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of\\r\\ncivility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the\\r\\ninstrument till her ladyship\\'s carriage was ready to take them all\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 32\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to\\r\\nJane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into\\r\\nthe village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the\\r\\ncertain signal of a visitor.  As she had heard no carriage, she\\r\\nthought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that\\r\\napprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she\\r\\nmight escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened,\\r\\nand, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only,\\r\\nentered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised\\r\\nfor his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all\\r\\nthe ladies were to be within.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were\\r\\nmade, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.  It was\\r\\nabsolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this\\r\\nemergence recollecting WHEN she had seen him last in\\r\\nHertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say\\r\\non the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.\\r\\nBingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right,\\r\\nhe went but the day before.  He and his sisters were well, I hope,\\r\\nwhen you left London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a\\r\\nshort pause added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of\\r\\never returning to Netherfield again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may\\r\\nspend very little of his time there in the future.  He has many\\r\\nfriends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are\\r\\ncontinually increasing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\\r\\nthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for\\r\\nthen we might possibly get a settled family there.  But, perhaps,\\r\\nMr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience\\r\\nof the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to\\r\\nkeep it or quit it on the same principle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up\\r\\nas soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer.  She was afraid of talking longer of\\r\\nhis friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined\\r\\nto leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very\\r\\ncomfortable house.  Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to\\r\\nit when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe she did-- and I am sure she could not have bestowed\\r\\nher kindness on a more grateful object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\\r\\nwife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with\\r\\none of the very few sensible women who would have accepted\\r\\nhim, or have made him happy if they had.  My friend has an\\r\\nexcellent understanding-- though I am not certain that I consider\\r\\nher marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.  She\\r\\nseems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is\\r\\ncertainly a very good match for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\r\\ndistance of her own family and friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An easy distance, do you call it?  It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more than half a\\r\\nday\\'s journey.  Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI should never have considered the distance as one of the\\r\\nADVANTAGES of the match,\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I should never\\r\\nhave said Mrs. Collins was settled NEAR her family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.\\r\\nAnything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I\\r\\nsuppose, would appear far.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied\\r\\nshe understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane\\r\\nand Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near\\r\\nher family.  The far and the near must be relative, and depend on\\r\\nmany varying circumstances.  Where there is fortune to make the\\r\\nexpenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.\\r\\nBut that is not the case HERE.  Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a\\r\\ncomfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent\\r\\njourneys-- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself\\r\\nNEAR her family under less than HALF the present distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"YOU\\r\\ncannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.  YOU\\r\\ncannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked surprised.  The gentleman experienced some\\r\\nchange of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper\\r\\nfrom the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the county ensued, on either\\r\\nside calm and concise-- and soon put an end to by the entrance\\r\\nof Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk.  The\\r\\ntete-a-tete surprised them.  Mr. Darcy related the mistake which\\r\\nhad occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a\\r\\nfew minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone.  \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he\\r\\nwould never have called us in this familiar way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very\\r\\nlikely, even to Charlotte\\'s wishes, to be the case; and after\\r\\nvarious conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to\\r\\n\\r\\nproceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was\\r\\nthe more probable from the time of year.  All field sports were\\r\\nover.  Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a\\r\\nbilliard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and\\r\\nin the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk\\r\\nto it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a\\r\\ntemptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\\r\\nThey called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\r\\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied\\r\\nby their aunt.  It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\ncame because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion\\r\\nwhich of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nreminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by\\r\\nhis evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George\\r\\nWickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was\\r\\nless captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners, she\\r\\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more\\r\\ndifficult to understand.  It could not be for society, as he\\r\\nfrequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his\\r\\nlips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity\\r\\nrather than of choice-- a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure  to\\r\\nhimself.  He seldom appeared really animated.  Mrs. Collins\\r\\nknew not what to make of him.  Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s\\r\\noccasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\\r\\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not\\r\\nhave told her; and as she would liked to have believed this\\r\\nchange the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend\\r\\nEliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out.  She\\r\\nwatched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he\\r\\ncame to Hunsford; but without much success.  He certainly\\r\\nlooked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look\\r\\nwas disputable.  It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\r\\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and\\r\\nsometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of\\r\\nhis being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea;\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from\\r\\nthe danger of raising expectations which might only end in\\r\\ndisappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt,\\r\\nthat all her friend\\'s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose\\r\\nhim to be in her power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her\\r\\nmarrying colonel Fitzwilliam.  He was beyond comparison the\\r\\nmost pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in\\r\\nlife was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages,\\r\\nMr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his\\r\\ncousin could have none at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 33\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\r\\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.  She felt all the perverseness of\\r\\nthe mischance that should bring him where no one else was\\r\\nbrought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to\\r\\ninform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.  How it\\r\\ncould occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!  Yet it did,\\r\\nand even a third.  It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary\\r\\npenance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal\\r\\ninquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually\\r\\nthought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.  He never\\r\\nsaid a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\r\\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\r\\nrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--\\r\\nabout her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary\\r\\nwalks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\\'s happiness; and\\r\\nthat in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding\\r\\nthe house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into\\r\\nKent again she would be staying THERE too.  His words\\r\\nseemed to imply it.  Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his\\r\\nthoughts?  She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean\\r\\nand allusion to what might arise in that quarter.  It distressed\\r\\nher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in\\r\\nthe pales opposite the Parsonage.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked in perusing Jane\\'s last\\r\\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane\\r\\nhad not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised\\r\\nby Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\nwas meeting her.  Putting away the letter immediately and\\r\\nforcing a smile, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I\\r\\n\\r\\ngenerally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the\\r\\nParsonage.  Are you going much farther?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\\r\\nParsonage together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- if Darcy does not put it off again.  But I am at his\\r\\ndisposal.  He arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at\\r\\nleast pleasure in the great power of choice.  I do not know\\r\\nanybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he\\r\\nlikes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam.  \"But so we all do.  It is only that he has better\\r\\nmeans of having it than many others, because he is rich, and\\r\\nmany others are poor.  I speak feelingly.  A younger son, you\\r\\nknow, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little\\r\\nof either.  Now seriously, what have you ever known of\\r\\nself-denial and dependence?  When have you been prevented by\\r\\nwant of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring\\r\\nanything you had a fancy for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are home questions-- and perhaps I cannot say that I\\r\\nhave experienced many hardships of that nature.  But in matters\\r\\nof greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.  Younger\\r\\nsons cannot marry where they like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they\\r\\nvery often do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too\\r\\nmany in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some\\r\\nattention to money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured\\r\\nat the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And\\r\\npray, what is the usual price of an earl\\'s younger son?  Unless\\r\\n\\r\\nthe elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask\\r\\nabove fifty thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.  To\\r\\ninterrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with\\r\\nwhat had passed, she soon afterwards said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for\\r\\nthe sake of  having someone at his disposal.  I wonder he does\\r\\nnot marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.  But,\\r\\nperhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is\\r\\nunder his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he\\r\\nmust divide with me.  I am joined with him in the guardianship\\r\\nof Miss Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you indeed?  And pray what sort of guardians do you\\r\\nmake?  Does your charge give you much trouble?  Young ladies\\r\\nof her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she\\r\\nhas the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the\\r\\nmanner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed\\r\\nMiss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her\\r\\nthat she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.  She\\r\\ndirectly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not be frightened.  I never heard any harm of her; and\\r\\nI dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\\r\\nShe is a very great favourite with some ladies of my\\r\\nacquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.  I think I have heard\\r\\nyou say that you know them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know them a little.  Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike\\r\\nman-- he is a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Care of him!  Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care of\\r\\nhim in those points where he most wants care.  From something\\r\\nthat he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think\\r\\nBingley very much indebted to him.  But I ought to beg his\\r\\npardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the\\r\\n\\r\\nperson meant.  It was all conjecture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally\\r\\nknown, because if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family, it\\r\\nwould be an unpleasant thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to\\r\\nbe Bingley.  What he told me was merely this: that he\\r\\ncongratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the\\r\\ninconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without\\r\\nmentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected\\r\\nit to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get\\r\\ninto a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been\\r\\ntogether the whole of last summer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections\\r\\nagainst the lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling.\\r\\n\"He only told me what I have now told you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling\\r\\nwith indignation.  After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked\\r\\nher why she was so thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Your cousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings.  Why was he\\r\\nto be the judge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the\\r\\npropriety of his friend\\'s inclination, or why, upon his own\\r\\njudgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner\\r\\nhis friend was to be happy.  But,\" she continued, recollecting\\r\\nherself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to\\r\\ncondemn him.  It is not to be supposed that there was much\\r\\n\\r\\naffection in the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\\r\\nlessening of the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer,\\r\\nand therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on\\r\\nindifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.  There, shut\\r\\ninto her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could\\r\\nthink without interruption of all that she had heard.  It was not\\r\\nto be supposed that any other people could be meant than those\\r\\nwith whom she was connected.  There could not exist in the\\r\\nworld TWO men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such\\r\\nboundless influence.  That he had been concerned in the\\r\\nmeasures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never\\r\\ndoubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the\\r\\nprincipal design and arrangement of them.  If his own vanity,\\r\\nhowever,  did not mislead him, HE was the cause, his pride and\\r\\ncaprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still\\r\\ncontinued to suffer.  He had ruined for a while every hope of\\r\\nhappiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world;\\r\\nand no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s words; and those strong objections\\r\\nprobably were, her having one uncle who was a country\\r\\nattorney, and another who was in business in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility\\r\\nof objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!-- her\\r\\nunderstanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners\\r\\ncaptivating.  Neither could anything be urged against my father,\\r\\nwho, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself need not disdain, and respectability which he will\\r\\nprobably never each.\"  When she thought of her mother, her\\r\\nconfidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any\\r\\nobjections THERE had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\r\\npride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\\r\\nthe want of importance in his friend\\'s connections, than from\\r\\ntheir want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he\\r\\nhad been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly\\r\\nby the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on\\r\\na headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening,\\r\\nthat, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined\\r\\nher not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were\\r\\nengaged to drink tea.  Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really\\r\\nunwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible\\r\\nprevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could\\r\\nnot conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\\'s being rather\\r\\ndispleased by her staying at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 34\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate\\r\\nherself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her\\r\\nemployment the examination of all the letters which Jane had\\r\\nwritten to her since her being in Kent.  They contained no actual\\r\\ncomplaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any\\r\\ncommunication of present suffering.  But in all, and in almost\\r\\nevery line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which\\r\\nhad been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding\\r\\nfrom the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\r\\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\\r\\nElizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of\\r\\nuneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the\\r\\nfirst perusal.  Mr. Darcy\\'s shameful boast of what misery he had\\r\\nbeen able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister\\'s\\r\\nsufferings.  It was some consolation to think that his visit to\\r\\nRosings was to end on the day after the next-- and, a still\\r\\ngreater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with\\r\\nJane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\r\\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not think of Darcy\\'s leaving Kent without\\r\\nremembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and\\r\\nagreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound\\r\\nof the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea\\r\\nof its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before\\r\\ncalled late in the evening, and might now come to inquire\\r\\nparticularly after her.  But this idea was soon banished, and her\\r\\n\\r\\nspirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter\\r\\namazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.  In an\\r\\nhurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health,\\r\\nimputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.  She\\r\\nanswered him with cold civility.  He sat down for a few\\r\\nmoments, and then getting up, walked about the room.\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.  After a silence of\\r\\nseveral minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and\\r\\nthus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In vain I have struggled.  It will not do.  My feelings will not be\\r\\nrepressed.  You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire\\r\\nand love you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s astonishment was beyond expression.  She stared,\\r\\ncoloured, doubted, and was silent.  This he considered sufficient\\r\\nencouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long\\r\\nfelt for her, immediately followed.  He spoke well; but there\\r\\nwere feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he\\r\\nwas not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of\\r\\npride.  His sense of her inferiority-- of its being a degradation--\\r\\nof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination,\\r\\nwere dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\\r\\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\\r\\nrecommend his suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible\\r\\nto the compliment of such a man\\'s affection, and though her\\r\\nintentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for\\r\\nthe pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his\\r\\nsubsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.  She\\r\\ntried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience,\\r\\nwhen he should have done.  He concluded with representing to\\r\\nher the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his\\r\\nendeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\r\\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her\\r\\nacceptance of his hand.  As he said this, she could easily see that\\r\\nhe had no doubt of a favourable answer.  He SPOKE of\\r\\napprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real\\r\\nsecurity.  Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther,\\r\\nand, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\r\\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed,\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever unequally they may be returned.  It is natural that\\r\\nobligation should be felt, and if I could FEEL gratitude, I would\\r\\nnow thank you.  But I cannot-- I have never desired your good\\r\\nopinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.  I\\r\\n\\r\\nam sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.  It has been most\\r\\nunconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short\\r\\nduration.  The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\\r\\nthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\\r\\novercoming it after this explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his\\r\\neyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less\\r\\nresentment than surprise.  His complexion became pale with\\r\\nanger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every\\r\\nfeature.  He was struggling for the appearance of composure,\\r\\nand would not open his lips till he believed himself to have\\r\\nattained it.  The pause was to Elizabeth\\'s feelings dreadful.  At\\r\\nlength, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is the reply which I am to have the honour of\\r\\nexpecting:  I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\\r\\nlittle ENDEAVOUR at civility, I am thus rejected.  But it is of\\r\\nsmall importance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \" why with so evident a\\r\\ndesire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that\\r\\nyou liked me against your will, against your reason, and even\\r\\nagainst your character?  Was not this some excuse for incivility,\\r\\nif I WAS uncivil?  But I have other provocations.  You know I\\r\\nhave.  Had not my feelings decided against you-- had they been\\r\\nindifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that\\r\\nany consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\\r\\nbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a\\r\\nmost beloved sister?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but\\r\\nthe emotion was short, and he listened without attempting\\r\\nto interrupt her while she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.  No motive\\r\\ncan excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted THERE.\\r\\nYou dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal,\\r\\nif not the only means of dividing them from each other-- of\\r\\nexposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and\\r\\n\\r\\ninstability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes,\\r\\nand involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\\r\\nlistening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any\\r\\nfeeling of remorse.  He even looked at her with a smile of\\r\\naffected incredulity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of\\r\\ndenying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend\\r\\nfrom your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.  Towards HIM I\\r\\nhave been kinder than towards myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil\\r\\nreflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\\r\\nconciliate her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my\\r\\ndislike is founded.  Long before it had taken place my opinion of\\r\\nyou was decided.  Your character was unfolded in the recital\\r\\nwhich I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.  On this\\r\\nsubject, what can you have to say?  In what imaginary act of\\r\\nfriendship can you here defend yourself?  or under what\\r\\nmisrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help\\r\\nfeeling an interest in him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his\\r\\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy.  \"You\\r\\nhave reduced him to his present state of poverty-- comparative\\r\\npoverty.  You have withheld the advantages which you must\\r\\nknow to have been designed for him.  You have deprived the\\r\\nbest years of his life of that independence which was no less his\\r\\ndue than his desert.  You have done all this!  and yet you can\\r\\ntreat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room, \"Is your opinion of me!  This is the estimation in\\r\\nwhich you hold me!  I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My\\r\\nfaults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!  But\\r\\nperhaps,\" added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards\\r\\nher, \"these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your\\r\\npride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had\\r\\nlong prevented my forming any serious design.  These bitter\\r\\naccusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\r\\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief\\r\\nof my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by\\r\\nreason, by reflection, by everything.  But disguise of every sort is\\r\\nmy abhorrence.  Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.\\r\\nThey were natural and just.  Could you expect me to rejoice in\\r\\nthe inferiority of your connections?-- to congratulate myself on\\r\\nthe hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly\\r\\nbeneath my own?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she\\r\\ntried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of\\r\\nyour declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared\\r\\nthe concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you\\r\\nbehaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible\\r\\nway that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with\\r\\nan expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.  She went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the very beginning-- from the first moment, I may almost\\r\\nsay-- of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me\\r\\nwith the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your\\r\\nselfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the\\r\\ngroundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have\\r\\nbuilt so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month\\r\\nbefore I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I\\r\\ncould ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam.  I perfectly comprehend\\r\\nyour feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own\\r\\n\\r\\nhave been.  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your\\r\\ntime, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth\\r\\nheard him the next moment open the front door and quit the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great.  She knew not\\r\\nhow to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and\\r\\ncried for half-an-hour.  Her astonishment, as she reflected on\\r\\nwhat had passed, was increased by every review of it.  That she\\r\\nshould receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!  That he\\r\\nshould have been in love with her for so many months!  So much\\r\\nin love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\\r\\nwhich had made him prevent his friend\\'s marrying her sister, and\\r\\nwhich must appear at least with equal force in his own case--\\r\\nwas almost incredible!  It was gratifying to have inspired\\r\\nunconsciously so strong an affection.  But his pride, his\\r\\nabominable pride-- his shameless avowal of what he had done\\r\\nwith respect to Jane-- his unpardonable assurance in\\r\\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling\\r\\nmanner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty\\r\\ntowards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the\\r\\npity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment\\r\\nexcited.  She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was\\r\\nto encounter Charlotte\\'s observation, and hurried her away to\\r\\nher room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 35\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and\\r\\nmeditations which had at length closed her eyes.  She could not\\r\\nyet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was\\r\\nimpossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for\\r\\nemployment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge\\r\\nherself in air and exercise.  She was proceeding directly to her\\r\\nfavourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\\'s sometimes\\r\\ncoming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she\\r\\nturned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road.\\r\\nThe park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon\\r\\npassed one of the gates into the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she\\r\\nwas tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the\\r\\ngates and look into the park.  The five weeks which she had now\\r\\npassed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and\\r\\nevery day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.  She was\\r\\non the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse\\r\\nof a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he\\r\\nwas moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was\\r\\ndirectly retreating.  But the person who advanced was now near\\r\\nenough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\r\\npronounced her name.  She had turned away; but on hearing\\r\\nherself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she moved again towards the gate.  He had by that time\\r\\nreached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively\\r\\ntook, said, with a look of haughty composure, \"I have been\\r\\nwalking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.  Will\\r\\nyou do me the honour of reading that letter?\"  And then, with a\\r\\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\r\\nElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\\r\\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper,\\r\\nwritten quite through, in a very close hand.  The envelope itself\\r\\nwas likewise full.  Pursuing her way along the lane, she then\\r\\nbegan it.  It was dated from Rosings, at eight o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning, and was as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\\r\\napprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments\\r\\nor renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to\\r\\nyou.  I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\\r\\nmyself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,\\r\\ncannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation\\r\\nand the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\\r\\nspared had not my character required it to be written and read.\\r\\nYou must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\r\\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly,\\r\\nbut I demand it of your justice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of\\r\\nequal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.  The first\\r\\nmentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had\\r\\ndetached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had,\\r\\nin defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\\r\\n\\r\\nhumanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\\r\\nprospects of Mr. Wickham.  Wilfully and wantonly to have\\r\\nthrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\r\\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\r\\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought\\r\\nup to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the\\r\\nseparation of two young persons, whose affection could be the\\r\\ngrowth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.  But\\r\\nfrom the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\\r\\nbestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the\\r\\nfuture secured, when the following account of my actions and\\r\\ntheir motives has been read.  If, in the explanation of them,\\r\\nwhich is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating\\r\\nfeelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I\\r\\nam sorry.  The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology\\r\\nwould be absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common\\r\\nwith others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other\\r\\nyoung woman in the country.  But it was not till the evening of\\r\\nthe dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his\\r\\nfeeling a serious attachment.  I had often seen him in love before.\\r\\nAt that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was\\r\\nfirst made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\\'s accidental\\r\\ninformation, that Bingley\\'s attentions to your sister had given\\r\\nrise to a general expectation of their marriage.  He spoke of it as\\r\\na certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\\r\\n>From that moment I observed my friend\\'s behaviour attentively;\\r\\nand I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was\\r\\nbeyond what I had ever witnessed in him.  Your sister I also\\r\\nwatched.  Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and\\r\\nengaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard,\\r\\nand I remained convinced from the evening\\'s scrutiny, that\\r\\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not\\r\\ninvite them by any participation of sentiment.  If YOU have not\\r\\nbeen mistaken here, I must have been in error.  Your superior\\r\\nknowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.  If it be\\r\\nso, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your\\r\\nresentment has not been unreasonable.  But I shall not scruple to\\r\\nassert, that the serenity of your sister\\'s countenance and air was\\r\\nsuch as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\\r\\nthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\\r\\neasily touched.  That I was desirous of believing her indifferent\\r\\nis certain-- but I will venture to say that my investigation and\\r\\ndecisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.  I did\\r\\n\\r\\nnot believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it\\r\\non impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.  My\\r\\nobjections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\\r\\nnight acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put\\r\\naside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so\\r\\ngreat an evil to my friend as to me.  But there were other causes\\r\\nof repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing\\r\\nto an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured\\r\\nto forget, because they were not immediately before me.  These\\r\\ncauses must be stated, though briefly.  The situation of your\\r\\nmother\\'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\r\\ncomparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so\\r\\nalmost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger\\r\\nsisters, and occasionally even by your father.  Pardon me.  It\\r\\npains me to offend you.  But amidst your concern for the defects\\r\\nof  your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\r\\nrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider\\r\\nthat, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of\\r\\nthe like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and\\r\\nyour elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and\\r\\ndisposition of both.  I will only say farther that from what passed\\r\\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\\r\\ninducement heightened which could have led me before to\\r\\npreserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\r\\nconnection.  He left Netherfield for London, on the day\\r\\nfollowing, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of\\r\\nsoon returning.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained.  His sisters\\'\\r\\nuneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\\r\\ncoincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible\\r\\nthat no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\\r\\nresolved on joining him directly in London.  We accordingly\\r\\nwent-- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out\\r\\nto my friend the certain evils of such a choice.  I described, and\\r\\nenforced them earnestly.  But, however this remonstrance might\\r\\nhave staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\\r\\nthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not\\r\\nbeen seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of\\r\\nyour sister\\'s indifference.  He had before believed her to return\\r\\nhis affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.  But Bingley\\r\\nhas great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my\\r\\njudgement than on his own.  To convince him, therefore, that he\\r\\nhad deceived himself, was no very difficult point.  To persuade\\r\\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction\\r\\n\\r\\nhad been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.  I cannot\\r\\nblame myself for having done thus much.  There is but one part\\r\\nof my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with\\r\\nsatisfaction; it is, that I condescended to adopt the measures of\\r\\nart so far as to conceal from him your sister\\'s being in town.  I\\r\\nknew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother\\r\\nis even yet ignorant of it.  That they might have met without ill\\r\\nconsequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear\\r\\nto me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\\r\\ndanger.  Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me;\\r\\nit is done, however, and it was done for the best.  On this subject\\r\\nI have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.  If I have\\r\\nwounded your sister\\'s feelings, it was unknowingly done and\\r\\nthough the motives which governed me may to you very\\r\\nnaturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having\\r\\ninjured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you\\r\\nthe whole of his connection with my family.  Of what he has\\r\\nPARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of\\r\\nwhat I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of\\r\\nundoubted veracity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for\\r\\nmany years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and\\r\\nwhose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally\\r\\ninclined my father to be of service to him; and on George\\r\\nWickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore\\r\\nliberally bestowed.  My father supported him at school, and\\r\\nafterwards at Cambridge-- most important assistance, as his own\\r\\nfather, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would\\r\\nhave been unable to give him a gentleman\\'s education.  My\\r\\nfather was not only fond of this young man\\'s society, whose\\r\\nmanner were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of\\r\\nhim, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to\\r\\nprovide for him in it.  As for myself, it is many, many years since\\r\\nI first began to think of him in a very different manner.  The\\r\\nvicious propensities-- the want of principle, which he was careful\\r\\nto guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\\r\\nthe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with\\r\\nhimself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded\\r\\nmoments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.  Here again shall\\r\\ngive you pain-- to what degree you only can tell.  But whatever\\r\\nmay be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\\r\\n\\r\\nsuspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\\r\\nreal character-- it adds even another motive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his\\r\\nattachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his\\r\\nwill he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\\r\\nadvancement in the best manner that his profession might\\r\\nallow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\\r\\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant.  There was also a\\r\\nlegacy of one thousand pounds.  His own father did not long\\r\\nsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.\\r\\nWickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved\\r\\nagainst taking orders, he hoped I should not think it\\r\\nunreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary\\r\\nadvantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\\r\\nbenefited.  He had some intention, he added, of studying law,\\r\\nand I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be a very insufficient support therein.  I rather wished,\\r\\nthan believed him to be sincere-- but, at any rate, was perfectly\\r\\nready to accede to his proposal.  I knew that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon\\r\\nsettled-- he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it\\r\\npossible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and\\r\\naccepted in return three thousand pounds.  All connection\\r\\nbetween us seemed now dissolved.  I thought too ill of him to\\r\\ninvite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.  In town I\\r\\nbelieve he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere\\r\\npretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life\\r\\nof idleness and dissipation.  For about three years I heard little of\\r\\nhim; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had\\r\\nbeen designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the\\r\\npresentation.  His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.  He had found\\r\\nthe law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\\r\\nresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living\\r\\nin question-- of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as\\r\\nhe was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\\r\\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father\\'s intentions.\\r\\nYou will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this\\r\\nentreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it.  His resentment\\r\\nwas in proportion to the distress of his circumstances-- and he\\r\\nwas doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\\r\\nreproaches to myself.  After this period every appearance of\\r\\nacquaintance was dropped.  How he lived I know not.  But last\\r\\nsummer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to\\r\\nforget myself, and which no obligation less than the present\\r\\nshould induce me to unfold to any human being.  Having said\\r\\nthus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.  My sister, who is\\r\\nmore than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of\\r\\nmy mother\\'s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.  About a\\r\\nyear ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment\\r\\nformed for her in London; and last summer she went with the\\r\\nlady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went\\r\\nMr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have\\r\\nbeen a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in\\r\\nwhose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her\\r\\nconnivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to\\r\\nGeorgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression\\r\\nof his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to\\r\\nbelieve herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.  She was\\r\\nthen but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\\r\\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it\\r\\nto herself.  I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the\\r\\nintended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\\r\\nidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost\\r\\nlooked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.  You\\r\\nmay imagine what I felt and how I acted.  Regard for my sister\\'s\\r\\ncredit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to\\r\\nMr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge\\r\\nwas of course removed from her charge.  Mr. Wickham\\'s object\\r\\nwas unquestionably my sister\\'s fortune, which is thirty thousand\\r\\npounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\\r\\nhimself on me was a strong inducement.  His revenge would\\r\\nhave been complete indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\\r\\nhave been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\\r\\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of\\r\\ncruelty towards Mr. Wickham.  I know not in what manner,\\r\\nunder what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his\\r\\nsuccess is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as you\\r\\npreviously were of everything concerning either.  Detection\\r\\ncould not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your\\r\\ninclination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last\\r\\nnight; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what\\r\\ncould or ought to be revealed.  For the truth of everything here\\r\\n\\r\\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and\\r\\nconstant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my\\r\\nfather\\'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every\\r\\nparticular of these transactions.  If your abhorrence of ME\\r\\nshould make MY assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\\r\\nby the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there\\r\\nmay be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to\\r\\nfind some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\\r\\ncourse of the morning.  I will only add, God bless you,\\r\\n                                   \"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 36\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect\\r\\nit to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no\\r\\nexpectation at all of its contents.  But such as they were, it may\\r\\nwell be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what\\r\\na contrariety of emotion they excited.  Her feelings as she read\\r\\nwere scarcely to be defined.  With amazement did she first\\r\\nunderstand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\\r\\nsteadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\r\\nto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.  With a\\r\\nstrong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his\\r\\naccount of what had happened at Netherfield.  She read with an\\r\\neagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and\\r\\nfrom impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring,\\r\\nwas incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her\\r\\neyes. His belief of her sister\\'s insensibility she instantly resolved\\r\\nto be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to\\r\\nthe match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him\\r\\njustice.  He expressed no regret for what he had done which\\r\\nsatisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.  It was all\\r\\npride and insolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\\r\\nWickham-- when she read with somewhat clearer attention a\\r\\nrelation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished\\r\\nopinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to\\r\\nhis own history of himself-- her feelings were yet more acutely\\r\\npainful and more difficult of definition.  Astonishment,\\r\\napprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.  She wished to\\r\\ndiscredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cannot be!  This must be the grossest falsehood!\"-- and\\r\\nwhen she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely\\r\\nknowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away,\\r\\nprotesting that she would not regard it, that she would never\\r\\nlook in it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\r\\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the\\r\\nletter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she\\r\\ncould, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related\\r\\nto Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the\\r\\nmeaning of every sentence.  The account of his connection with\\r\\nthe Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself;\\r\\nand the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not\\r\\nbefore known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\\r\\nwords.  So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she\\r\\ncame to the will, the difference was great.  What Wickham had\\r\\nsaid of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled\\r\\nhis very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross\\r\\nduplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she\\r\\nflattered herself that her wishes did not err.  But when she read\\r\\nand re-read with the closest attention, the particulars\\r\\nimmediately following of Wickham\\'s resigning all pretensions to\\r\\nthe living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\r\\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.  She put\\r\\ndown the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she\\r\\nmeant to be impartiality-- deliberated on the probability of each\\r\\nstatement-- but with little success.  On both sides it was only\\r\\nassertion.  Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly\\r\\nthat the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any\\r\\ncontrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy\\'s conduct\\r\\nin it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make\\r\\nhim entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not\\r\\nto lay at Mr. Wickham\\'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the\\r\\nmore so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.  She had\\r\\nnever heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia,\\r\\nin which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man\\r\\nwho, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a\\r\\nslight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life nothing had been\\r\\nknown in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.  As to his real\\r\\ncharacter, had information been in her power, she had never felt\\r\\na wish of inquiring.  His countenance, voice, and manner had\\r\\nestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue.  She\\r\\n\\r\\ntried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\\r\\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\\r\\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue,\\r\\natone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour\\r\\nto class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of\\r\\nmany years\\' continuance.  But no such recollection befriended\\r\\nher.  She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of\\r\\nair and address; but she could remember no more substantial\\r\\ngood than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\\r\\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.\\r\\nAfter pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more\\r\\ncontinued to read.  But, alas! the story which followed, of his\\r\\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what\\r\\nhad passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the\\r\\nmorning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of\\r\\nevery particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself-- from whom she\\r\\nhad previously received the information of his near concern in all\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to\\r\\nquestion.  At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\\r\\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the\\r\\napplication, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\\r\\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had\\r\\nnot been well assured of his cousin\\'s corroboration.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\\r\\nconversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening\\r\\nat Mr. Phillips\\'s.  Many of his expressions were still fresh in her\\r\\nmemory.  She was NOW struck with the impropriety of such\\r\\ncommunications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her\\r\\nbefore.  She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he\\r\\nhad done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his\\r\\nconduct.  She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\r\\nof seeing Mr. Darcy-- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country,\\r\\nbut that HE should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the\\r\\nNetherfield ball the very next week.  She remembered also that,\\r\\ntill the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his\\r\\nstory to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had\\r\\nbeen everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no\\r\\nscruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\\'s character, though he had assured\\r\\nher that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing\\r\\nthe son.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was\\r\\nconcerned!  His attentions to Miss King were now the\\r\\nconsequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the\\r\\n\\r\\nmediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his\\r\\nwishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.  His behaviour to\\r\\nherself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either\\r\\nbeen deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\r\\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she\\r\\nhad most incautiously shown.  Every lingering struggle in his\\r\\nfavour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she could not but allow Mr. Bingley, when questioned by\\r\\nJane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that\\r\\nproud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the\\r\\nwhole course of their acquaintance-- an acquaintance which\\r\\nhad latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of\\r\\nintimacy with his ways-- seen anything that betrayed him to be\\r\\nunprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or\\r\\nimmoral habits; that among his own connections he was\\r\\nesteemed and valued-- that even Wickham had allowed him\\r\\nmerit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so\\r\\naffectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some\\r\\namiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham\\r\\nrepresented them, so gross a violation of everything right could\\r\\nhardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship\\r\\nbetween a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as\\r\\nBingley, was incomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.  Of neither Darcy nor\\r\\nWickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,\\r\\npartial, prejudiced, absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided\\r\\nmyself on my discernment!  I, who have valued myself on my\\r\\nabilities!  who have often disdained the generous candour of my\\r\\nsister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\\r\\nHow humiliating is this discovery!  yet, how just a humiliation!\\r\\nHad I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\\r\\nBut vanity, not love, has been my folly.  Pleased with the\\r\\npreference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on\\r\\nthe very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\r\\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where\\r\\neither were concerned.  Till this moment I never knew myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n>From herself to Jane-- from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were\\r\\nin a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nexplanation THERE had appeared very insufficient, and she read\\r\\nit again.  Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.\\r\\nHow could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich she had been obliged to give in the other?  He declared\\r\\nhimself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister\\'s attachment; and\\r\\nshe could not help remembering what Charlotte\\'s opinion had\\r\\nalways been.  Neither could she deny the justice of his\\r\\ndescription of Jane.  She felt that Jane\\'s feelings, though fervent,\\r\\nwere little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency\\r\\nin her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\r\\nmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her\\r\\nsense of shame was severe.  The justice of the charge struck her\\r\\ntoo forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he\\r\\nparticularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and\\r\\nas confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a\\r\\nstronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.  It\\r\\nsoothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had\\r\\nthus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she\\r\\nconsidered that Jane\\'s disappointment had in fact been the work\\r\\nof her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit\\r\\nof both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt\\r\\ndepressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to\\r\\nevery variety of thought--re-considering events, determining\\r\\nprobabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a\\r\\nchange so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection\\r\\nof her long absence, made her at length return home; and she\\r\\nentered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,\\r\\nand the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make\\r\\nher unfit for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings\\r\\nhad each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few\\r\\nminutes, to take leave-- but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been\\r\\nsitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and\\r\\nalmost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\\r\\nElizabeth could but just AFFECT concern in missing him; she\\r\\nreally rejoiced at it.  Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an\\r\\nobject; she could think only of her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 37\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr.\\r\\nCollins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his\\r\\nparting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing\\r\\nintelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as\\r\\ntolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene\\r\\nso lately gone through at Rosings.  To Rosings he then hastened,\\r\\nto console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\r\\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her\\r\\nladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her\\r\\nvery desirous of having them all to dine with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,\\r\\nhad she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to\\r\\nher as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of\\r\\nwhat her ladyship\\'s indignation would have been.  \"What would\\r\\nshe have said? how would she have behaved?\" were questions\\r\\nwith which she amused herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.  \"I\\r\\nassure you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe\\r\\nno one feels the loss of friends so much as I do.  But I am\\r\\nparticularly attached to these young men, and know them to be\\r\\nso much attached to me!  They were excessively sorry to go!\\r\\nBut so they always are.  The dear Colonel rallied his spirits\\r\\ntolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,\\r\\nmore, I think, than last year.  His attachment to Rosings\\r\\ncertainly increases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,\\r\\nwhich were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed\\r\\nout of spirits. And immediately accounting for it by herself, by\\r\\nsupposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg\\r\\nthat you may stay a little longer.  Mrs. Collins will be very glad\\r\\nof your company, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\"\\r\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it.  I must\\r\\nbe in town next Saturday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.  I\\r\\nexpected you to stay two months.  I told Mrs. Collins so before\\r\\nyou came.  There can be no occasion for your going so soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my father cannot.  He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\\r\\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father.  And if\\r\\nyou will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in my power\\r\\nto take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in\\r\\nJune, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the\\r\\nbarouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--\\r\\nand indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not\\r\\nobject to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by\\r\\nour original plan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned.  \"Mrs. Collins, you must send\\r\\na servant with them.  You know I always speak my mind, and I\\r\\ncannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by\\r\\nthemselves.  It is highly improper.  You must contrive to send\\r\\nsomebody.  I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of\\r\\nthing.  Young women should always be properly guarded and\\r\\nattended, according to their situation in life.  When my niece\\r\\nGeorgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\r\\nhaving two men-servants go with her.  Miss Darcy, the daughter\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have\\r\\nappeared with propriety in a different manner.  I am excessively\\r\\nattentive to all those things.  You must send John with the young\\r\\nladies, Mrs. Collins.  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it;\\r\\nfor it would really be discreditable to YOU to let them go\\r\\nalone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Your uncle!  He keeps a man-servant, does he?  I am very\\r\\nglad you have somebody who thinks of these things.  Where\\r\\nshall you change horses?  Oh!  Bromley, of course.  If you\\r\\nmention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their\\r\\njourney, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was\\r\\nnecessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with\\r\\n\\r\\na mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nReflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she\\r\\nwas alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day\\r\\nwent by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all\\r\\nthe delight of unpleasant recollections.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by\\r\\nheart.  She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its\\r\\nwriter were at times widely different.  When she remembered the\\r\\nstyle of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she\\r\\nconsidered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,\\r\\nher anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed\\r\\nfeelings became the object of compassion.  His attachment\\r\\nexcited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could\\r\\nnot approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\\r\\nor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.  In her\\r\\nown past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation\\r\\nand regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a constant\\r\\nsource of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her\\r\\nfamily, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.  They were hopeless of\\r\\nremedy.  Her father, contented with laughing at them, would\\r\\nnever exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest\\r\\ndaughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\r\\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil.  Elizabeth had\\r\\nfrequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the\\r\\nimprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were\\r\\nsupported by their mother\\'s indulgence, what chance could there\\r\\nbe of improvement?  Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and\\r\\ncompletely under Lydia\\'s guidance, had been always affronted\\r\\nby their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\r\\nscarcely give them a hearing.  They were ignorant, idle, and vain.\\r\\nWhile there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him;\\r\\nand while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would\\r\\nbe going there forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxiety on Jane\\'s behalf was another prevailing concern; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former\\r\\ngood opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.  His\\r\\naffection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct\\r\\ncleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness\\r\\nof his confidence in his friend.  How grievous then was the\\r\\nthought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so\\r\\nreplete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\r\\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last\\r\\nweek of her stay as they had been at first.  The very last evening\\r\\nwas spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into\\r\\nthe particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the\\r\\nbest method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of\\r\\nplacing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself\\r\\nobliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and\\r\\npack her trunk afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,\\r\\nwished them a good journey, and invited them to come to\\r\\nHunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so\\r\\nfar as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 38\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for\\r\\nbreakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took\\r\\nthe opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed\\r\\nindispensably necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs. Collins has\\r\\nyet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I\\r\\nam very certain you will not leave the house without receiving\\r\\nher thanks for it.  The favor of your company has been much\\r\\nfelt, I assure you.  We know how little there is to tempt any one\\r\\nto our humble abode.  Our plain manner of living, our small\\r\\nrooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world,\\r\\nmust make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\r\\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the\\r\\ncondescension, and that we have done everything in our power\\r\\nto prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of\\r\\nhappiness.  She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and\\r\\nthe pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she\\r\\nhad received, must make HER feel the obliged.  Mr. Collins was\\r\\ngratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\r\\ntime not disagreeably.  We have certainly done our best; and\\r\\nmost fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to  very\\r\\nsuperior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the\\r\\n\\r\\nfrequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we\\r\\nmay flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been\\r\\nentirely irksome.  Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nfamily is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing\\r\\nwhich few can boast.  You see on what a footing we are.  You\\r\\nsee how continually we are engaged there.  In truth I must\\r\\nacknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble\\r\\nparsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\\r\\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he\\r\\nwas obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to\\r\\nunite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\r\\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin.  I flatter myself at least that you\\r\\nwill be able to do so. Lady Catherine\\'s great attentions to Mrs.\\r\\nCollins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it\\r\\ndoes not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate----\\r\\nBut on this point it will be as well to be silent.  Only let me\\r\\nassure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart\\r\\nmost cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.  My dear\\r\\nCharlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.\\r\\nThere is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\r\\ncharacter and ideas between us.  We seem to have been designed\\r\\nfor each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where\\r\\nthat was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she\\r\\nfirmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.  She was\\r\\nnot sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the\\r\\nlady from whom they sprang.  Poor Charlotte!  it was\\r\\nmelancholy to leave her to such society!  But she had chosen it\\r\\nwith her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her\\r\\nvisitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.\\r\\nHer home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and\\r\\nall their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the\\r\\nparcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.  After\\r\\nan affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was\\r\\nattended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked\\r\\ndown the garden he was commissioning her with his best\\r\\nrespects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the\\r\\nkindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\\r\\n\\r\\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.  He\\r\\nthen handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the\\r\\npoint of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with\\r\\nsome consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any\\r\\nmessage for the ladies at Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble\\r\\nrespects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their\\r\\nkindness to you while you have been here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be\\r\\nshut, and the carriage drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes\\' silence, \"it\\r\\nseems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many\\r\\nthings have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there\\r\\ntwice!  How much I shall have to tell!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth added privately, \"And how much I shall have to\\r\\nconceal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any\\r\\nalarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they\\r\\nreached Mr. Gardiner\\'s house, where they were to remain a few\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of\\r\\nstudying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the\\r\\nkindness of her aunt had reserved for them.  But Jane was to go\\r\\nhome with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough\\r\\nfor observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait\\r\\neven for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nproposals.  To know that she had the power of revealing what\\r\\nwould so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time,\\r\\nso highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet\\r\\nbeen able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as\\r\\nnothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in\\r\\nwhich she remained as to the extent of what she should\\r\\ncommunicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of\\r\\n\\r\\nbeing hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might\\r\\nonly grieve her sister further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 39\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies\\r\\nset out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in\\r\\nHertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived,\\r\\nin token of the coachman\\'s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia\\r\\nlooking out of a dining-room upstairs.  These two girls had been\\r\\nabove an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an\\r\\nopposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a\\r\\nsalad and cucumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table\\r\\nset out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords,\\r\\nexclaiming, \"Is not this nice?  Is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia, \"but you must\\r\\nlend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out\\r\\nthere.\"  Then, showing her purchases-- \"Look here, I have\\r\\nbought this bonnet.  I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought\\r\\nI might as well buy it as not.  I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I\\r\\nget home, and see if I can not make it up any better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\r\\nunconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the\\r\\nshop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to\\r\\ntrim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.  Besides, it will\\r\\nnot much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire\\r\\nhave left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are they indeed!\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so\\r\\nwant papa to take us all there for the summer!  It would be such\\r\\na delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at\\r\\nall.  Mamma would like to go too of all things!  Only think what\\r\\na miserable summer else we shall have!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"THAT would be a delightful scheme\\r\\nindeed, and completely do for us at once.  Good Heaven!\\r\\nBrighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been\\r\\n\\r\\noverset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly\\r\\nballs of Meryton!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat\\r\\ndown at table.  \"What do you think?  It is excellent news--\\r\\ncapital news-- and about a certain person we all like!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told\\r\\nhe need not stay.  Lydia laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.  You\\r\\nthought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!  I dare say he\\r\\noften hears worse things said than I am going to say.  But he is\\r\\nan ugly fellow!  I am glad he is gone.  I never saw such a long\\r\\nchin in my life.  Well, but now for my news; it is about dear\\r\\nWickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?  There is no danger\\r\\nof Wickham\\'s marrying Mary King.  There\\'s for you!  She is\\r\\ngone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.  Wickham is\\r\\nsafe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a\\r\\nconnection imprudent as to fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said\\r\\nJane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure there is not on HIS.  I will answer for it, he never\\r\\ncared three straws about her-- who could about such a nasty\\r\\nlittle freckled thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\r\\ncoarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of the\\r\\nSENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had\\r\\nharboured and fancied liberal!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\r\\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all\\r\\ntheir boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition\\r\\nof Kitty\\'s and Lydia\\'s purchases, were seated in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in,\" cried Lydia.  \"I am glad I\\r\\nbought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another\\r\\nbandbox!  Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and\\r\\n\\r\\ntalk and laugh all the way home.  And in the first place, let us\\r\\nhear what has happened to you all since you went away.  Have\\r\\nyou seen any pleasant men?  Have you had any flirting?  I was in\\r\\ngreat hopes that one of you would have got a husband before\\r\\nyou came back.  Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\r\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty!  My aunt Phillips wants you so\\r\\nto get husbands, you can\\'t think.  She says Lizzy had better have\\r\\ntaken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been\\r\\nany fun in it.  Lord! how I should like to be married before any\\r\\nof you!  and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\r\\nDear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at\\r\\nColonel Forster\\'s.  Kitty and me were to spend the day there,\\r\\nand Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening;\\r\\n(by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she\\r\\nasked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so\\r\\nPen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think\\r\\nwe did?  We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\'s clothes on\\r\\npurpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!  Not a soul\\r\\nknew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me,\\r\\nexcept my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her\\r\\ngowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!  When\\r\\nDenny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the\\r\\nmen came in, they did not know him in the least.  Lord!  how I\\r\\nlaughed! and so did Mrs. Forster.  I thought I should have died.\\r\\nAnd THAT made the men suspect something, and then they\\r\\nsoon found out what was the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\r\\nLydia, assisted by Kitty\\'s hints and additions, endeavour to\\r\\namuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlistened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the\\r\\nfrequent mention of Wickham\\'s name.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception at home was most kind.  Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to\\r\\nsee Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during\\r\\ndinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\\r\\nLucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various\\r\\nwere the subjects that occupied them:  Lady Lucas was inquiring\\r\\nof Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter;\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an\\r\\naccount of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way\\r\\n\\r\\nbelow her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger\\r\\nLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other\\r\\nperson\\'s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning\\r\\nto anybody who would hear her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had\\r\\nsuch fun!  As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and\\r\\npretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have\\r\\ngone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got\\r\\nto the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we\\r\\ntreated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the\\r\\nworld, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you\\r\\ntoo.  And then when we came away it was such fun!  I thought\\r\\nwe never should have got into the coach.  I was ready to die of\\r\\nlaughter.  And then we were so merry all the way home!  we\\r\\ntalked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us\\r\\nten miles off!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear\\r\\nsister, to depreciate such pleasures!  They would doubtless be\\r\\ncongenial with the generality of female minds.  But I confess\\r\\nthey would have no charms for ME-- I should infinitely prefer a\\r\\nbook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word.  She seldom listened\\r\\nto anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to\\r\\nMary at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to\\r\\nwalk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but\\r\\nElizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.  It should not be said\\r\\nthat the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before\\r\\nthey were in pursuit of the officers.  There was another reason\\r\\ntoo for her opposition.  She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again,\\r\\nand was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.  The comfort to\\r\\nHER of the regiment\\'s approaching removal was indeed beyond\\r\\nexpression.  In a fortnight they were to go-- and once gone, she\\r\\nhoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the\\r\\nBrighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the\\r\\ninn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.\\r\\nElizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest\\r\\nintention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so\\r\\nvague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\r\\n\\r\\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 40\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened\\r\\ncould no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to\\r\\nsuppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and\\r\\npreparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next\\r\\nmorning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet\\'s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong\\r\\nsisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear\\r\\nperfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other\\r\\nfeelings.  She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his\\r\\nsentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but\\r\\nstill more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\\'s\\r\\nrefusal must have given him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she, \"and\\r\\ncertainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it\\r\\nmust increase his disappointment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he\\r\\nhas other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his\\r\\nregard for me.  You do not blame me, however, for refusing\\r\\nhim?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blame you!  Oh, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you WILL know it, when I tell you what happened the very\\r\\nnext day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents\\r\\nas far as they concerned George Wickham.  What a stroke was\\r\\nthis for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the\\r\\nworld without believing that so much wickedness existed in the\\r\\nwhole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.\\r\\nNor was Darcy\\'s vindication, though grateful to her feelings,\\r\\n\\r\\ncapable of consoling her for such discovery.  Most earnestly did\\r\\nshe labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the\\r\\none without involving the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to\\r\\nmake both of them good for anything.  Take your choice, but\\r\\nyou must be satisfied with only one.  There is but such a quantity\\r\\nof merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of\\r\\nman; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.  For my\\r\\npart, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\\'s; but you shall do as\\r\\nyou choose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted\\r\\nfrom Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Wickham so very bad!  It is almost past belief.  And poor Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.\\r\\nSuch a disappointment!  and with the knowledge of your ill\\r\\nopinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister!  It is\\r\\nreally too distressing.  I am sure you must feel it so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing\\r\\nyou so full of both.  I know you will do him such ample justice,\\r\\nthat I am growing every moment more unconcerned and\\r\\nindifferent.  Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament\\r\\nover him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\r\\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the\\r\\neducation of those two young men.  One has got all the\\r\\ngoodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the APPEARANCE\\r\\nof it as you used to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided\\r\\na dislike to him, without any reason.  It is such a spur to one\\'s\\r\\ngenius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\\r\\nOne may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but\\r\\none cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then\\r\\nstumbling on something witty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not\\r\\ntreat the matter as you do now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, I could not.  I was uncomfortable enough, I may say\\r\\nunhappy.  And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no\\r\\nJane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and\\r\\nvain and nonsensical as I knew I had!  Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong\\r\\nexpressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they\\r\\nDO appear wholly undeserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.  But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a\\r\\nmost natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\\r\\nencouraging.  There is one point on which I want your advice.  I\\r\\nwant to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our\\r\\nacquaintances in general understand Wickham\\'s character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can\\r\\nbe no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.  What is your\\r\\nopinion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted.  Mr. Darcy has not\\r\\nauthorised me to make his communication public.  On the\\r\\ncontrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be\\r\\nkept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to\\r\\nundeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe\\r\\nme?  The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that\\r\\nit would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to\\r\\nattempt to place him in an amiable light.  I am not equal to it.\\r\\nWickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\\r\\nanyone here what he really is.  Some time hence it will be all\\r\\nfound out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not\\r\\nknowing it before.  At present I will say nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right.  To have his errors made public might ruin\\r\\nhim for ever.  He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done,\\r\\nand anxious to re-establish a character.  We must not make him\\r\\ndesperate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth\\'s mind was allayed by this conversation.\\r\\nShe had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her\\r\\nfor a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,\\r\\nwhenever she might wish to talk again of either.  But there was\\r\\nstill something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the\\r\\n\\r\\ndisclosure.  She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nletter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been\\r\\nvalued by her friend.  Here was knowledge in which no one\\r\\ncould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a\\r\\nperfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\\r\\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery.  \"And then,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall\\r\\nmerely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more\\r\\nagreeable manner himself.  The liberty of communication cannot\\r\\nbe mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the\\r\\nreal state of her sister\\'s spirits.  Jane was not happy.  She still\\r\\ncherished a very tender affection for Bingley.  Having never even\\r\\nfancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of\\r\\nfirst attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater\\r\\nsteadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so\\r\\nfervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every\\r\\nother man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\r\\nfeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of\\r\\nthose regrets which must have been injurious to her own health\\r\\nand their tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion\\r\\nNOW of this sad business of Jane\\'s?  For my part, I am\\r\\ndetermined never to speak of it again to anybody.  I told my\\r\\nsister Phillips so the other day.  But I cannot find out that Jane\\r\\nsaw anything of him in London.  Well, he is a very undeserving\\r\\nyoung man-- and I do not suppose there\\'s the least chance in the\\r\\nworld of her ever getting him now.  There is no talk of his\\r\\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired\\r\\nof everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses.  Nobody wants him to come.\\r\\nThough I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and\\r\\nif I was her, I would not have put up with it.  Well, my comfort\\r\\nis, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be\\r\\nsorry for what he has done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\\r\\nexpectation, she made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards, \"and so\\r\\n\\r\\nthe Collinses live very comfortable, do they?  Well, well, I only\\r\\nhope it will last.  And what sort of table do they keep?  Charlotte\\r\\nis an excellent manager, I dare say.  If she is half as sharp as her\\r\\nmother, she is saving enough.  There is nothing extravagant in\\r\\nTHEIR housekeeping, I dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.  Yes, yes.\\r\\nTHEY will take care not to outrun their income.  THEY will\\r\\nnever be distressed for money.  Well, much good may it do\\r\\nthem!  And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  They look upon it as quite their own,\\r\\nI dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no\\r\\ndoubt they often talk of it between themselves.  Well, if they can\\r\\nbe easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the\\r\\nbetter.  I should be ashamed of having one that was only\\r\\nentailed on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 41\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.\\r\\nIt was the last of the regiment\\'s stay in Meryton, and all the\\r\\nyoung ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.  The\\r\\ndejection was almost universal.  The elder Miss Bennets alone\\r\\nwere still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual\\r\\ncourse of their employments.  Very frequently were they\\r\\nreproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own\\r\\nmisery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\r\\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us?  What are we to do?\"\\r\\nwould they often exclaiming the bitterness of woe.  \"How can\\r\\nyou be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered\\r\\nwhat she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty\\r\\nyears ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when\\r\\nColonel Miller\\'s regiment went away.  I thought I should have\\r\\nbroken my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I shall break MINE,\" said Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!-- if one could but go to Brighton!  But papa is so\\r\\ndisagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal of\\r\\ngood,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually\\r\\nthrough Longbourn House.  Elizabeth tried to be diverted by\\r\\nthem; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.  She felt anew\\r\\nthe justice of Mr. Darcy\\'s objections; and never had she been so\\r\\nmuch disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the gloom of Lydia\\'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for\\r\\nshe received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the\\r\\ncolonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.  This\\r\\ninvaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately\\r\\nmarried.  A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had\\r\\nrecommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their\\r\\nTHREE months\\' acquaintance they had been intimate TWO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.\\r\\nForster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of\\r\\nKitty, are scarcely to be described.  Wholly inattentive to her\\r\\nsister\\'s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy,\\r\\ncalling for every one\\'s congratulations, and laughing and talking\\r\\nwith more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued\\r\\nin the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her\\r\\naccent was peevish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well as\\r\\nLydia,\" said she, \"Though I am NOT her particular friend.  I\\r\\nhave just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for\\r\\nI am two years older.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane\\r\\nto make her resigned.  As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation\\r\\nwas so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother\\r\\nand Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all\\r\\npossibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such\\r\\na step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly\\r\\nadvising her father not to let her go.  She represented to him all\\r\\nthe improprieties of Lydia\\'s general behaviour, the little\\r\\nadvantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman\\r\\nas Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\r\\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the\\r\\ntemptations must be greater than at home.  He heard her\\r\\nattentively, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some\\r\\npublic place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with\\r\\nso little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the\\r\\npresent circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great\\r\\ndisadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of\\r\\nLydia\\'s unguarded and imprudent manner-- nay, which has\\r\\nalready arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in\\r\\nthe affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet.  \"What, has she\\r\\nfrightened away some of your lovers?  Poor little Lizzy!  But do\\r\\nnot be cast down.  Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be\\r\\nconnected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.  Come,\\r\\nlet me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by\\r\\nLydia\\'s folly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken.  I have no such injuries to resent.  It is\\r\\nnot of particular, but of general evils, which I am now\\r\\ncomplaining.  Our importance, our respectability in the world\\r\\nmust be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain\\r\\nof all restraint which mark Lydia\\'s character.  Excuse me, for I\\r\\nmust speak plainly.  If you, my dear father, will not take the\\r\\ntrouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her\\r\\nthat her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she\\r\\nwill soon be beyond the reach of amendment.  Her character will\\r\\nbe fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\r\\nthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\\r\\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction\\r\\nbeyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance\\r\\n\\r\\nand emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any\\r\\nportion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration\\r\\nwill excite.  In this danger Kitty also is comprehended.  She will\\r\\nfollow wherever Lydia leads.  Vain, ignorant, idle, and\\r\\nabsolutely uncontrolled!  Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it\\r\\npossible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\r\\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved\\r\\nin the disgrace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\r\\naffectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane\\r\\nare known you must be respected and valued; and you will not\\r\\nappear to less advantage for having a couple of-- or I may say,\\r\\nthree-- very silly sisters.  We shall have no peace at Longbourn if\\r\\nLydia does not go to Brighton.  Let her go, then.  Colonel\\r\\nForster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real\\r\\nmischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to\\r\\nanybody.  At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a\\r\\ncommon flirt than she has been here.  The officers will find\\r\\nwomen better worth their notice.  Let us hope, therefore, that\\r\\nher being there may teach her her own insignificance.  At any\\r\\nrate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising\\r\\nus to lock her up for the rest of her life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her\\r\\nown opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed\\r\\nand sorry.  It was not in her nature, however, to increase her\\r\\nvexations by dwelling on them.  She was confident of having\\r\\nperformed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or\\r\\naugment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her\\r\\nconference with her father, their indignation would hardly have\\r\\nfound expression in their united volubility.  In Lydia\\'s\\r\\nimagination, a visit to Brighton comprised ever possibility of\\r\\nearthly happiness.  She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the\\r\\nstreets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.  She saw\\r\\nherself  the object to tens and to scores of them at present\\r\\nunknown.  She saw all the glories of the camp-- its tents\\r\\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with\\r\\nthe young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to\\r\\ncomplete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent,\\r\\ntenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects\\r\\nand such realities as these, what would have been her\\r\\nsensations?  They could have been understood only by her\\r\\nmother, who might have felt nearly the same.  Lydia\\'s going to\\r\\nBrighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction\\r\\nof her husband\\'s never intending to go there himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their\\r\\nraptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of\\r\\nLydia\\'s leaving home.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.\\r\\nHaving been frequently in company with him since her return,\\r\\nagitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality\\r\\nentirely so.  She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness\\r\\nwhich had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to\\r\\ndisgust and weary.  In his present behaviour to herself,\\r\\nmoreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the\\r\\ninclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\r\\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,\\r\\nafter what had since passed, to provoke her.  She lost all concern\\r\\nfor him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle\\r\\nand frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could\\r\\nnot but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however\\r\\nlong, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn,\\r\\nher vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any\\r\\ntime by their renewal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very last day of the regiment\\'s remaining at Meryton, he\\r\\ndined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was\\r\\nElizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his\\r\\nmaking some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had\\r\\npassed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and\\r\\nasked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked surprised displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\'s\\r\\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly\\r\\nseen him often; and, after observing that he was a very\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.  Her\\r\\nanswer was warmly in his favour.  With an air of indifference he\\r\\nsoon afterwards added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very different.  But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape\\r\\nher.  \"And pray, may I ask?-- \"  But checking himself, he added,\\r\\nin a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves?  Has he\\r\\ndeigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?-- for I dare\\r\\nnot hope,\" he continued in a lower and more serious tone, \"that\\r\\nhe is improved in essentials.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth.  \"In essentials, I believe, he is very\\r\\nmuch what he ever was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing\\r\\nwhether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.\\r\\nThere was a something in her countenance which made him\\r\\nlisten with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean\\r\\nthat his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but\\r\\nthat, from knowing him better, his disposition was better\\r\\nunderstood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and\\r\\nagitated look; for a few minuted he was silent, till, shaking off\\r\\nhis embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the\\r\\ngentlest of accents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will\\r\\nreadily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise\\r\\nenough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is right.\\r\\nHis pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself,\\r\\nto many others, for it must only deter him from such foul\\r\\nmisconduct as I have suffered by.  I only fear that the sort of\\r\\ncautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\\r\\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion\\r\\n\\r\\nand judgement he stands much in awe.  His fear of her has\\r\\nalways operated, I know, when they were together; and a good\\r\\ndeal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with\\r\\nMiss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only\\r\\nby a slight inclination of the head.  She saw that he wanted to\\r\\nengage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in\\r\\nno humour to indulge him.  The rest of the evening passed with\\r\\nthe APPEARANCE, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with\\r\\nno further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at\\r\\nlast with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never\\r\\nmeeting again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to\\r\\nMeryton, from whence they were to set out early the next\\r\\nmorning.  The separation between her and her family was rather\\r\\nnoisy than pathetic.  Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but\\r\\nshe did weep from vexation and envy.  Mrs. Bennet was diffuse\\r\\nin her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and\\r\\nimpressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\\r\\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible-- advice\\r\\nwhich there was every reason to believe would be well attended\\r\\nto; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding\\r\\nfarewell, the more gentle adieux of her sisters were uttered\\r\\nwithout being heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 42\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Elizabeth\\'s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she\\r\\ncould not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal\\r\\nfelicity or domestic comfort.  Her father, captivated by youth\\r\\nand beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth\\r\\nand beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak\\r\\nunderstanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage\\r\\nput and end to all real affection for her.  Respect, esteem, and\\r\\nconfidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic\\r\\nhappiness were overthrown.  But Mr. Bennet was not of a\\r\\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his\\r\\nown imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which\\r\\ntoo often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice.  He\\r\\nwas fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had\\r\\narisen his principal enjoyments.  To his wife he was very little\\r\\n\\r\\notherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had\\r\\ncontributed to his amusement.  This is not the sort of happiness\\r\\nwhich a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but\\r\\nwhere other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\r\\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of\\r\\nher father\\'s behaviour as a husband.  She had always seen it with\\r\\npain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate\\r\\ntreatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could\\r\\nnot overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual\\r\\nbreach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing\\r\\nhis wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly\\r\\nreprehensible.  But she had never felt so strongly as now the\\r\\ndisadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a\\r\\nmarriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from\\r\\nso ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\\r\\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,\\r\\neven if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\'s departure she\\r\\nfound little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the\\r\\nregiment.  Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and\\r\\nat home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at\\r\\nthe dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over\\r\\ntheir domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her\\r\\nnatural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were\\r\\nremoved, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil\\r\\nmight be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly\\r\\nand assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\r\\nwatering-place and a camp.  Upon the whole, therefore, she\\r\\nfound, what has been sometimes been found before, that an\\r\\nevent to which she had been looking with impatient desire did\\r\\nnot, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised\\r\\nherself.  It was consequently necessary to name some other\\r\\nperiod for the commencement of actual felicity-- to have some\\r\\nother point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and\\r\\nby again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for\\r\\nthe present, and prepare for another disappointment.  Her tour\\r\\nto the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was\\r\\nher best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the\\r\\ndiscontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and\\r\\ncould she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it\\r\\nwould have been perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish\\r\\nfor.  Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment\\r\\nwould be certain.  But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless\\r\\nsource of regret in my sister\\'s absence, I may reasonably hope to\\r\\nhave all my expectations of pleasure realised.  A scheme of\\r\\nwhich every part promises delight can never be successful; and\\r\\ngeneral disappointment is only warded off by the defence of\\r\\nsome little peculiar vexation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and\\r\\nvery minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were\\r\\nalways long expected, and always very short.  Those to her\\r\\nmother contained little else than that they were just returned\\r\\nfrom the library, where such and such officers had attended\\r\\nthem, and where she had seen such beautiful  ornaments as made\\r\\nher quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\r\\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave\\r\\noff in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were\\r\\ngoing off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her\\r\\nsister,  there was still less to be learnt-- for her letters to Kitty,\\r\\nthough rather longer, were much too full of lines under the\\r\\nwords to be made public.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\r\\ngood humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\\r\\nEverything wore a happier aspect.  The families who had been in\\r\\ntown for the winter came back again, and summer finery and\\r\\nsummer engagements arose.  Mrs. Bennet was restored to her\\r\\nusual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was\\r\\nso much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears;\\r\\nan event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that\\r\\nby the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable\\r\\nas not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some\\r\\ncruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another\\r\\nregiment should be quartered in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now\\r\\nfast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a\\r\\nletter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its\\r\\ncommencement and curtailed its extent.  Mr. Gardiner would be\\r\\nprevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in\\r\\nJuly, and must be in London again within a month, and as that\\r\\nleft too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much\\r\\nas they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and\\r\\ncomfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the\\r\\n\\r\\nLakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to\\r\\nthe present plan, were to go no farther northwards than\\r\\nDerbyshire.  In that county there was enough to be seen to\\r\\noccupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it\\r\\nhad a peculiarly strong attraction.  The town where she had\\r\\nformerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now\\r\\nto spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her\\r\\ncuriosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\r\\nDovedale, or the Peak.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\\r\\nseeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time\\r\\nenough.  But it was her business to be satisfied-- and certainly\\r\\nher temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas\\r\\nconnected.  It was impossible for her to see the word without\\r\\nthinking of Pemberley and its owner.  \"But surely,\" said she, \"I\\r\\nmay enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few\\r\\npetrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled.  Four weeks were\\r\\nto pass away before her uncle and aunt\\'s arrival.  But they did\\r\\npass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children,\\r\\ndid at length appear at Longbourn.  The children, two girls of six\\r\\nand eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under\\r\\nthe particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general\\r\\nfavourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper\\r\\nexactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--\\r\\nteaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off\\r\\nthe next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and\\r\\namusement.  One enjoyment was certain-- that of suitableness of\\r\\ncompanions; a suitableness which comprehended health and\\r\\ntemper to bear inconveniences-- cheerfulness to enhance every\\r\\npleasure-- and affection and intelligence, which might supply it\\r\\namong themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of\\r\\nDerbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which\\r\\ntheir route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,\\r\\nBirmingham, &c., are sufficiently known.  A small part of\\r\\nDerbyshire is all the present concern.  To the little town of\\r\\nLambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s former residence, and\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained,\\r\\nthey bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders\\r\\nof the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth\\r\\nfound from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.  It was not in\\r\\ntheir direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.  In\\r\\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner\\r\\nexpressed an inclination to see the place again.  Mr. Gardiner\\r\\ndeclared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her\\r\\napprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\\r\\nheard so much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which so\\r\\nmany of your acquaintances are connected.  Wickham passed all\\r\\nhis youth there, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was distressed.  She felt that she had no business at\\r\\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\\r\\nit.  She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\\r\\ngoing over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\\r\\nsatin curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.  If it were merely a fine\\r\\nhouse richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it\\r\\nmyself; but the grounds are delightful.  They have some of the\\r\\nfinest woods in the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said no more-- but her mind could not acquiesce.  The\\r\\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,\\r\\ninstantly occurred.  It would be dreadful!  She blushed at the\\r\\nvery idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her\\r\\naunt than to run such a risk.  But against this there were\\r\\nobjections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last\\r\\nresource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family\\r\\nwere unfavourably answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the\\r\\nchambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?\\r\\nwhat was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm,\\r\\nwhether the family were down for the summer?  A most\\r\\nwelcome negative followed the last question-- and her alarms\\r\\nnow being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\r\\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was\\r\\nrevived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could\\r\\nreadily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had\\r\\nnot really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore,\\r\\nthey were to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 43\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance\\r\\nof Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at\\r\\nlength they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high\\r\\nflutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\\r\\nThey entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some\\r\\ntime through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\\r\\nadmired every remarkable spot and point of view.  They\\r\\ngradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves\\r\\nat the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased,\\r\\nand the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated\\r\\non the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some\\r\\nabruptness wound.  It was a large, handsome stone building,\\r\\nstanding well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\\r\\nwoody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance\\r\\nwas swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.\\r\\nIts banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwas delighted.  She had never seen a place for which nature had\\r\\ndone more, or where natural beauty had been so little\\r\\ncounteracted by an awkward taste.  They were all of them warm\\r\\nin their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be\\r\\nmistress of Pemberley might be something!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\\r\\ndoor; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all\\r\\nher apprehension of meeting its owner returned.  She dreaded\\r\\nlest the chambermaid had been mistaken.  On applying to see\\r\\nthe place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as\\r\\nthey waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her\\r\\nbeing where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman,\\r\\nmuch less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of\\r\\nfinding her.  They followed her into the dining-parlour.  It was\\r\\na large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.\\r\\nElizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy\\r\\nits prospect.  The hill, crowned with wood, which they had\\r\\ndescended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\\r\\nwas a beautiful object.  Every disposition of the ground was\\r\\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees\\r\\nscattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as\\r\\nshe could trace it, with delight.  As they passed into other\\r\\nrooms these objects were taking different positions; but from\\r\\nevery window there were beauties to be seen.  The rooms were\\r\\nlofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune\\r\\nof its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste,\\r\\nthat it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\\r\\nsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress!\\r\\nWith these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\\r\\nInstead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in\\r\\nthem as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle\\r\\nand aunt.  But no,\" recollecting herself-- \"that could never be;\\r\\nmy uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not\\r\\nhave been allowed to invite them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a lucky recollection-- it saved her from something\\r\\nvery like regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master\\r\\nwas really absent, but had not the courage for it.  At length\\r\\nhowever, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned\\r\\naway with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was,\\r\\nadding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of\\r\\nfriends.\"  How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey\\r\\nhad not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture.  She approached\\r\\nand saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst\\r\\nseveral other miniatures, over the mantelpiece.  Her aunt asked\\r\\nher, smilingly, how she liked it.  The housekeeper came forward,\\r\\nand told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of\\r\\nher late master\\'s steward, who had been brought up by him at\\r\\nhis own expense.  \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\\r\\n\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not return it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\\r\\nminiatures, \"is my master-- and very like him.  It was drawn at\\r\\nthe same time as the other-- about eight years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face.  But,\\r\\nLizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\r\\nintimation of her knowing her master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\\'am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery\\r\\nupstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\\r\\nThis room was my late master\\'s favourite room, and these\\r\\nminiatures are just as they used to be then.  He was very fond\\r\\nof them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\\'s being among\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss\\r\\nDarcy, drawn when she was only eight\\r\\nyears old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and\\r\\nso accomplished!-- She plays and sings all day long.  In the next\\r\\nroom is a new instrument just come down for her-- a present\\r\\nfrom my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,\\r\\nencouraged her communicativeness by his questions and\\r\\nremarks:  Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had\\r\\nevidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend\\r\\nhalf his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the\\r\\nsummer months.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when THAT will be.  I do not\\r\\nknow who is good enough for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.  Elizabeth could not help saying,\\r\\n\"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think\\r\\nso.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that\\r\\nknows him,\" replied the other.  Elizabeth thought this was\\r\\ngoing pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment\\r\\nas the housekeeper added, \"I have never known a cross word\\r\\nfrom him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was\\r\\nfour years old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite\\r\\nto her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been\\r\\nher firmest opinion.  Her keenest attention was awakened; she\\r\\nlonged to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.  You\\r\\nare lucky in having such a master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am.  If I were to go through the world, I\\r\\ncould not meet with a better.  But I have always observed, that\\r\\nthey who are good-natured when children, are good-natured\\r\\nwhen they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered,\\r\\nmost generous-hearted boy in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth almost stared at her.  \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\nthought she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like\\r\\nhim-- just as affable to the poor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for\\r\\nmore.  Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She\\r\\nrelated the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms,\\r\\nand the price of the furniture, in vain, Mr. Gardiner, highly\\r\\namused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed\\r\\nher excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to\\r\\nthe subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as\\r\\nthey proceeded together up the great staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that\\r\\never lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of\\r\\nnothing but themselves.  There is not one of his tenants or\\r\\nservants but will give him a good name.  Some people call him\\r\\nproud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it.  To my fancy, it\\r\\nis only because he does not rattle away like other young men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked,\\r\\n\"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a\\r\\nvery pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance\\r\\nand lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that\\r\\nit was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had\\r\\ntaken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked\\r\\ntowards one of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\'s delight, when she\\r\\nshould enter the room.  \"And this is always the way with him,\"\\r\\nshe added.  \"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to\\r\\nbe done in a moment.  There is nothing he would not do for\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,\\r\\nwere all that remained to be shown.  In the former were many\\r\\ngood paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from\\r\\nsuch as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned\\r\\nto look at some drawings of Miss Darcy\\'s, in crayons, whose\\r\\nsubjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could\\r\\nhave little to fix the attention of a stranger.  Elizabeth walked in\\r\\nquest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\\r\\nAt last it arrested her-- and she beheld a striking resemblance to\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered\\r\\nto have sometimes seen when he looked at her.  She stood\\r\\nseveral minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation,\\r\\nand returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.  Mrs.\\r\\nReynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\\'s\\r\\nlifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\'s mind, a more\\r\\ngentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at\\r\\nthe height of their acquaintance.  The commendation bestowed\\r\\non him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise\\r\\nis more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?  As a\\r\\nbrother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people\\'s\\r\\nhappiness were in his guardianship!-- how much of pleasure or\\r\\npain was it in his power to bestow!-- how much of good or evil\\r\\nmust be done by him!  Every idea that had been brought forward\\r\\nby the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\\r\\nstood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed\\r\\nhis eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper\\r\\nsentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she\\r\\nremembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of\\r\\nexpression.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had\\r\\nbeen seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the\\r\\nhousekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met\\r\\nthem at the hall-door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth\\r\\nturned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and\\r\\nwhile the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,\\r\\nthe owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,\\r\\nwhich led behind it to the stables.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\\r\\nhis appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.  Their\\r\\neyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with\\r\\nthe deepest blush.  He absolutely started, and for a moment\\r\\nseemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself,\\r\\nadvanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in\\r\\nterms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\r\\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to\\r\\nbe overcome.  Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to\\r\\nthe picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to\\r\\nassure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the\\r\\ngardener\\'s expression of surprise, on beholding his master,\\r\\nmust immediately have told it.  They stood a little aloof while\\r\\nhe was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\r\\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what\\r\\nanswer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.\\r\\nAmazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted,\\r\\nevery sentence that he uttered was increasing her\\r\\nembarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her\\r\\nbeing found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in\\r\\nwhich they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\\r\\nher life.  Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke,\\r\\nhis accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\\r\\ninquiries as to the time of  her having left Longbourn, and of her\\r\\nhaving stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way,\\r\\nas plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a\\r\\nfew moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected\\r\\nhimself, and took leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his\\r\\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed\\r\\nby her own feelings, followed them in silence.  She was\\r\\noverpowered by shame and vexation.  Her coming there was\\r\\nthe most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!\\r\\nHow strange it must appear to him!  In what a disgraceful light\\r\\nmight it not strike so vain a man!  It might seem as if she had\\r\\npurposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she\\r\\ncome?  Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?\\r\\nHad they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been\\r\\nbeyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he\\r\\nwas that moment arrived-- that moment alighted from his horse\\r\\nor his carriage.  She blushed again and again over the\\r\\nperverseness of the meeting.  And his behaviour, so strikingly\\r\\naltered-- what could it mean?  That he should even speak to her\\r\\nwas amazing!-- but to speak with such civility, to inquire after\\r\\nher family!  Never in her life had she seen his manners so little\\r\\ndignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this\\r\\nunexpected meeting.  What a contrast did it offer to his last\\r\\naddress in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!\\r\\nShe  knew not what to think, or how to account for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\\r\\nand every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or\\r\\na finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but\\r\\nit was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\\r\\nthough she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of\\r\\nher uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such\\r\\nobjects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the\\r\\nscene.  Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of\\r\\nPemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\r\\nwas.  She longed to know what at the moment was passing in\\r\\nhis mind-- in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in\\r\\ndefiance of everything, she was still dear to him.  Perhaps he\\r\\nhad been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had\\r\\nbeen THAT in his voice which was not like ease.  Whether he\\r\\nhad felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not\\r\\ntell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her\\r\\nabsence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of\\r\\nappearing more like herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\\r\\nwhile, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots\\r\\nwhere the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander,\\r\\nwere many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills,\\r\\nwith the long range of woods overspreading many, and\\r\\noccasionally part of the stream.  Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\\r\\nof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a\\r\\nwalk.  With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten\\r\\nmiles round.  It settled the matter; and they pursued the\\r\\naccustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time,\\r\\nin a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water,\\r\\nand one of its narrowest parts.  They crossed it by a simple\\r\\nbridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a\\r\\nspot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley,\\r\\nhere contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\\r\\nand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which\\r\\nbordered it.  Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when\\r\\nthey had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from\\r\\nthe house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go\\r\\nno farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as\\r\\nquickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit,\\r\\nand they took their way towards the house on the opposite side\\r\\nof the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was\\r\\nslow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste,\\r\\nwas very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching\\r\\nthe occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and\\r\\ntalking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.\\r\\nWhilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again\\r\\nsurprised, and Elizabeth\\'s astonishment was quite equal to what\\r\\nit had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them,\\r\\nand at no great distance.  The walk here being here less\\r\\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\r\\nthey met.  Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\\r\\nprepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear\\r\\nand to speak with calmness, if we really intended to meet them.\\r\\nFor a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably\\r\\nstrike into some other path.  The idea lasted while a turning in\\r\\nthe walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he\\r\\nwas immediately before them.  With a glance, she saw that he\\r\\nhad lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\\r\\npoliteness, she began as they to admire the beauty of the place;\\r\\nbut she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and\\r\\n\"charming,\" when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she\\r\\nfancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be\\r\\nmischievously construed.  Her colour changed, and she said no\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\\r\\nhe asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him\\r\\nto her friends.  This was a stroke of civility for which she was\\r\\nquite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\\r\\nbeing now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very\\r\\npeople against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to\\r\\nherself.  \"What will be his surprise,\" thought she, \"when he\\r\\nknows who they are?  He takes them now for people of\\r\\nfashion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she\\r\\nnamed their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him,\\r\\nto see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of\\r\\nhis decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful\\r\\ncompanions.  That he was SURPRISED by the connection was\\r\\nevident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from\\r\\ngoing away, turned his back with them, and entered into\\r\\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner.  Elizabeth could not but be\\r\\npleased, could not but triumph.  It was consoling that he should\\r\\nknow she had some relations for whom there was no need to\\r\\nblush.  She listened most attentively to all that passed between\\r\\nthem, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her\\r\\nuncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good\\r\\nmanners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\\r\\nDarcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often\\r\\nas he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering\\r\\nat the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing\\r\\nout those parts of the stream where there was usually most\\r\\nsport.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\\r\\nElizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.  Elizabeth\\r\\nsaid nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\\r\\nmust be all for herself.  Her astonishment, however, was\\r\\nextreme, and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so\\r\\naltered?  From what can it proceed?  It cannot be for ME-- it\\r\\ncannot be for MY sake that his manners are thus softened.  My\\r\\nreproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.  It\\r\\nis impossible that he should still love me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after\\r\\ndescending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of\\r\\nsome curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.\\r\\nIt originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of\\r\\nthe morning, found Elizabeth\\'s arm inadequate to her support,\\r\\nand consequently preferred her husband\\'s.  Mr. Darcy took her\\r\\nplace by her niece, and they walked on together.  After a short\\r\\nsilence, the lady first spoke.  She wished him to know that she\\r\\nhad been assured of his absence before she came to the place,\\r\\nand accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\r\\nvery unexpected-- \"for your housekeeper,\" she added,\\r\\n\"informed us that you would certainly not be here till\\r\\nto-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we\\r\\nunderstood that you were not immediately expected in the\\r\\ncountry.\"  He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\\r\\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a\\r\\nfew hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been\\r\\ntravelling.  \"They will join me early to-morrow ,\" he continued,\\r\\n\"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with\\r\\nyou-- Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow.  Her thoughts were\\r\\ninstantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\\'s name had\\r\\nbeen the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge\\r\\nby his complexion, HIS mind was not very differently engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after\\r\\na pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you.\\r\\nWill you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister\\r\\nto your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\\r\\ngreat for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.  She\\r\\nimmediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\\r\\nbeing acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\\r\\nwithout looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to\\r\\nknow that is resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\\r\\nElizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\\r\\nflattered and pleased.  His wish of introducing his sister to her\\r\\nwas a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\\r\\nothers, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house-- but she declared\\r\\nherself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.  At such\\r\\na time much might have been said, and silence was very\\r\\nawkward.  She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an\\r\\nembargo on every subject.  At last she recollected that she had\\r\\nbeen travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\\r\\ngreat perseverance.  Yet time and her aunt moved slowly-- and\\r\\nher patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the\\r\\ntete-a-tete was over.  On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s coming up\\r\\nthey were all pressed to go into the house and take some\\r\\nrefreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each\\r\\nside with utmost politeness.  Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into\\r\\nthe carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking\\r\\nslowly towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\\r\\nthem pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\\r\\nhad expected.  \"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\\r\\nunassuming,\" said her uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There IS something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\\r\\naunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.  I can\\r\\nnow say with the housekeeper, that though some people may\\r\\ncall him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.  It was\\r\\nmore than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity\\r\\nfor such attention.  His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very\\r\\ntrifling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as\\r\\nWickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham\\'s countenance, for\\r\\nhis features are perfectly good.  But how came you to tell me\\r\\nthat he was so disagreeable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\\r\\nliked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\\r\\nshe had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\"\\r\\nreplied her uncle.  \"Your great men often are; and therefore I\\r\\nshall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\\r\\nanother day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character,\\r\\nbut said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I\\r\\nreally should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\\r\\ncruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.  He\\r\\nhas not an ill-natured look.  On the contrary, there is something\\r\\npleasing about his mouth when he speaks.  And there is\\r\\nsomething of dignity in his countenance that would not give one\\r\\nan unfavourable idea of his heart.  But, to be sure, the good lady\\r\\nwho showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\\r\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.  But he is a liberal\\r\\nmaster, I suppose, and THAT in the eye of a servant\\r\\ncomprehends every virtue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\\r\\nvindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave\\r\\nthem to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that\\r\\nby what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions\\r\\nwere capable of a very different construction; and that his\\r\\ncharacter was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\\'s so amiable,\\r\\nas they had been considered in Hertfordshire.  In confirmation\\r\\nof this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\r\\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually\\r\\nnaming her authority, but stating as such as might be relied on.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were\\r\\nnow approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea\\r\\ngave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much\\r\\nengaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots\\r\\nin its environs to think of anything else.  Fatigued as she had\\r\\nbeen by the morning\\'s walk they had no sooner dined than she\\r\\nset off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the\\r\\nevening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed\\r\\nafter many years\\' discontinuance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave\\r\\nElizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she\\r\\ncould do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be\\r\\nacquainted with his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 44\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to\\r\\nvisit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was\\r\\nconsequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole\\r\\nof that morning.  But her conclusion was false; for on the very\\r\\nmorning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.\\r\\nThey had been walking about the place with some of their new\\r\\nfriends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves\\r\\nfor dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage\\r\\ndrew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady\\r\\nin a curricle driving up the street.  Elizabeth immediately\\r\\nrecognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no\\r\\nsmall degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them\\r\\nwith the honour which she expected.  Her uncle and aunt were\\r\\nall amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she\\r\\nspoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the\\r\\ncircumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea\\r\\non the business.  Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they\\r\\nfelt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions\\r\\nfrom such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.\\r\\nWhile these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the\\r\\nperturbation of Elizabeth\\'s feelings was at every moment\\r\\nincreasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but\\r\\namongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality\\r\\nof the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more\\r\\nthan commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that\\r\\nevery power of pleasing would fail her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\\r\\nwalked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose\\r\\nherself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and\\r\\naunt as made everything worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\\r\\nintroduction took place.  With astonishment did Elizabeth see\\r\\nthat her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as\\r\\nherself.  Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss\\r\\nDarcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few\\r\\nminutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.  She\\r\\nfound it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a\\r\\nmonosyllable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\\r\\nthough little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\\r\\nappearance womanly and graceful.  She was less handsome than\\r\\nher brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face,\\r\\nand her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.\\r\\nElizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and\\r\\nunembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was\\r\\nmuch relieved by discerning such different feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\\r\\nBingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time\\r\\nto express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\\r\\nBingley\\'s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\\r\\nentered the room.  All Elizabeth\\'s anger against him had been\\r\\nlong done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have\\r\\nstood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\\r\\nexpressed himself on seeing her again.  He inquired in a friendly,\\r\\nthough general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with\\r\\nthe same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\\r\\npersonage than to herself.  They had long wished to see him.\\r\\nThe whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.\\r\\nThe suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their\\r\\nniece directed their observation towards each with an earnest\\r\\nthough guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those\\r\\ninquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\\r\\nit was to love.  Of the lady\\'s sensations they remained a little in\\r\\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration\\r\\nwas evident enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do.  She wanted to\\r\\nascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to\\r\\ncompose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in\\r\\nthe latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most\\r\\nsure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give\\r\\npleasure were prepossessed in her favour.  Bingley was ready,\\r\\nGeorgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and,\\r\\noh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were\\r\\ndirected in a like manner.  Sometimes she could fancy that he\\r\\ntalked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\\r\\nherself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to\\r\\ntrace a resemblance .  But, though this might be imaginary, she\\r\\ncould not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who\\r\\nhad been set up as a rival to Jane.  No look appeared on either\\r\\nside that spoke particular regard.  Nothing occurred between\\r\\nthem that could justify the hopes of his sister.  On this point she\\r\\nwas soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances\\r\\noccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation,\\r\\ndenoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness,\\r\\nand a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her,\\r\\nhad he dared.  He observed to her, at a moment when the others\\r\\nwere talking together, and in a tone which had something of real\\r\\nregret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had the\\r\\npleasure of seeing her\"; and, before she could reply, he added,\\r\\n\"It is above eight months.  We have not met since the 26th of\\r\\nNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\\r\\nafterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by\\r\\nany of the rest, whether ALL her sisters were at Longbourn.\\r\\nThere was not much in the question, nor in the preceding\\r\\nremark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\\r\\nexpression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\\r\\nheard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his\\r\\ncompanions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners\\r\\nwhich she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its\\r\\nexistence might prove, had at least outlived one day.  When she\\r\\nsaw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good\\r\\nopinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago\\r\\nwould have been a disgrace-- when she saw him thus civil, not\\r\\nonly to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly\\r\\ndisdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford\\r\\nParsonage-- the difference, the change was so great, and struck\\r\\nso forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her\\r\\nastonishment from being visible.  Never, even in the company of\\r\\nhis dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at\\r\\nRosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\r\\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no\\r\\nimportance could result from the success of his endeavours, and\\r\\nwhen even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions\\r\\nwere addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of\\r\\nthe ladies both of Netherfield as Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when\\r\\nthey arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him\\r\\nin expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and\\r\\nMiss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the\\r\\ncountry.  Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked\\r\\nher little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.  Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how SHE,\\r\\nwhom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\r\\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.  Presuming\\r\\nhowever, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary\\r\\nembarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her\\r\\nhusband, who was fond or society, a perfect willingness to\\r\\naccept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the\\r\\nday after the next was fixed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing\\r\\nElizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many\\r\\ninquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nconstruing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister,\\r\\nwas pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found\\r\\nherself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the\\r\\nlast half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was\\r\\npassing, the enjoyment of it had been little.  Eager to be alone,\\r\\nand fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she\\r\\nstayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable\\r\\nopinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s curiosity;\\r\\nit was not their wish to force her communication.  It was evident\\r\\nthat she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they\\r\\nhad before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in\\r\\nlove with her.  They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify\\r\\ninquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,\\r\\nas far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\\r\\nThey could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they\\r\\ndrawn his character from their own feelings and his servant\\'s\\r\\nreport, without any reference to any other account, the circle in\\r\\nHertfordshire to which he was known would not have\\r\\nrecognized it for Mr. Darcy.  There was now an interest,\\r\\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became\\r\\nsensible that the authority of a servant who had known him\\r\\nsince he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated\\r\\nrespectability, was not to be hastily rejected.  Neither had\\r\\nanything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends\\r\\nthat could materially lessen its weight.  They had nothing to\\r\\naccuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it\\r\\nwould certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small\\r\\nmarket-town where the family did not visit.  It was\\r\\nacknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did\\r\\nmuch good among the poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was\\r\\nnot held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his\\r\\nconcerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly\\r\\nunderstood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting\\r\\nDerbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.\\r\\nDarcy afterwards discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening\\r\\nmore than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it\\r\\nseemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings\\r\\ntowards ONE in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole\\r\\nhours endeavouring to make them out.  She certainly did not\\r\\nhate him.  No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had\\r\\nalmost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against\\r\\nhim, that could be so called.  The respect created by the\\r\\nconviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly\\r\\nadmitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her\\r\\nfeeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier\\r\\nnature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing\\r\\nforward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday\\r\\nhad produced.  But above all, above respect and esteem, there\\r\\nwas  a motive within her of goodwill which could not be\\r\\noverlooked.  It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having\\r\\nonce loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all\\r\\nthe petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and\\r\\nall the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.  He who,\\r\\nshe had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy,\\r\\nseemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the\\r\\nacquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or\\r\\nany peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were\\r\\nconcerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and\\r\\nbent on making her known to his sister.  Such a change in a\\r\\nman of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but\\r\\ngratitude-- for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as\\r\\nsuch its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by\\r\\nno means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.\\r\\nShe respected, she esteemed, he was grateful to him, she felt a\\r\\nreal interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\\r\\nfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far\\r\\nit would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the\\r\\npower, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing\\r\\non her the renewal of his addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the\\r\\nniece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\'s in coming to\\r\\nsee them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she\\r\\nhad reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated,\\r\\nthough it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness\\r\\non their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly\\r\\nexpedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.\\r\\nThey were, therefore, to go.  Elizabeth was pleased; though\\r\\nwhen she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in\\r\\nreply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.  The fishing scheme\\r\\nhad been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement\\r\\nmade of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before\\r\\nnoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 45\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\\'s dislike of\\r\\nher had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how\\r\\nunwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and\\r\\nwas curious to know with how much civility on that lady\\'s side\\r\\nthe acquaintance would now be renewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into\\r\\nthe saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for\\r\\nsummer.  Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most\\r\\nrefreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and\\r\\nof the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were\\r\\nscattered over the intermediate lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was\\r\\nsitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady\\r\\nwith whom she lived in London.  Georgiana\\'s reception of them\\r\\nwas very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which,\\r\\nthough proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong,\\r\\nwould easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief\\r\\nof her being proud and reserved.  Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\\r\\nhowever, did her justice, and pitied her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a\\r\\ncurtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such\\r\\npauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.  It was\\r\\nfirst broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking\\r\\nwoman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse\\r\\nproved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others;\\r\\nand between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\r\\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on.  Miss Darcy looked\\r\\nas if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes\\r\\ndid venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its\\r\\nbeing heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\\r\\nBingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss\\r\\nDarcy, without calling her attention.  This observation would not\\r\\nhave prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not\\r\\nbeen seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to\\r\\nbe spared the necessity of saying much.  Her own thoughts were\\r\\nemploying her.  She expected every moment that some of the\\r\\ngentlemen would enter the room.  She wished, she feared that\\r\\nthe master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\r\\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.\\r\\nAfter sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from\\r\\nher a cold inquiry after the health of her family.  She answered\\r\\nwith equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by\\r\\nthe entrance of the servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety\\r\\nof all the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a\\r\\nvariety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take\\r\\nplace till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.\\r\\nAnnesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her\\r\\npost.  There was now employment for the whole party-- for\\r\\nthough they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\r\\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon\\r\\ncollected them round the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\\r\\nwhether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;\\r\\nand then, though but a moment before she had believed her\\r\\nwishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or\\r\\nthree other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river,\\r\\nand had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family\\r\\nintended a visit to Georgiana that morning.  No sooner did he\\r\\nappear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and\\r\\nunembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but\\r\\nperhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the\\r\\nsuspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and\\r\\nthat there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his\\r\\nbehaviour when he first came into the room.  In no countenance\\r\\nwas attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nin spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she\\r\\nspoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her\\r\\ndesperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means\\r\\nover.  Miss Darcy, on her brother\\'s entrance, exerted herself\\r\\nmuch more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that she was anxious for\\r\\nhis sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much\\r\\nas possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.  Miss\\r\\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger,\\r\\ntook the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from\\r\\nMeryton?  They must be a great loss to YOUR family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Darcy\\'s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\'s name;\\r\\nbut Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in\\r\\nher thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him\\r\\ngave her a moment\\'s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to\\r\\nrepel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question\\r\\nin a tolerably detached tone.  While she spoke, an involuntary\\r\\nglance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,\\r\\nearnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion,\\r\\nand unable to lift up her eyes.  Had Miss Bingley know what\\r\\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly\\r\\nwould have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended\\r\\nto discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man\\r\\nto whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility\\r\\nwhich might injure her in Darcy\\'s opinion, and, perhaps, to\\r\\nremind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some\\r\\npart of her family were connected with that corps.  Not a\\r\\nsyllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\'s meditated\\r\\nelopement.  To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\r\\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\'s\\r\\nconnections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it,\\r\\nfrom the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to\\r\\nhim, of their becoming hereafter her own.  He had certainly\\r\\nformed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect\\r\\nhis endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable\\r\\n that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare\\r\\nof his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his\\r\\nemotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared\\r\\nnot approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in\\r\\ntime, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her\\r\\nbrother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her\\r\\ninterest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been\\r\\ndesigned to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\\r\\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer\\r\\nabove mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to\\r\\ntheir carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms\\r\\non Elizabeth\\'s person, behaviour, and dress.  But Georgiana\\r\\nwould not join her.  Her brother\\'s recommendation was enough\\r\\nto ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had\\r\\nspoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without\\r\\nthe power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.\\r\\nWhen Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\\r\\n repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\"\\r\\nshe cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she\\r\\nis since the winter.  She is grown so brown and coarse!  Louisa\\r\\nand I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he\\r\\ncontented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no\\r\\nother alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous\\r\\nconsequence of travelling in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never\\r\\ncould see any beauty in her.  Her face is too thin; her\\r\\ncomplexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all\\r\\nhandsome.  Her nose wants character-- there is nothing marked\\r\\nin its lines.  Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common\\r\\nway; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so\\r\\nfine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.  They\\r\\nhave a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her\\r\\nair altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is\\r\\nintolerable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth,\\r\\nthis was not the best method of recommending herself; but\\r\\nangry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look\\r\\nsomewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.  He was\\r\\nresolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making\\r\\nhim speak, she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how\\r\\namazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I\\r\\nparticularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been\\r\\ndining at Netherfield, \\'SHE a beauty!  I should as soon call her\\r\\nmother a wit.\\'  But afterwards she seemed to improve on you,\\r\\nand I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but\\r\\nTHAT was only when I first saw her, for it is many months\\r\\nsince I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of\\r\\nmy acquaintances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\\r\\nsatisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\\r\\npain but herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned,\\r\\nexcept what had particularly interested them both.  The look and behaviour of everybody they had\\r\\nseen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.  They talked\\r\\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit-- of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing\\r\\nto know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified\\r\\nby her niece\\'s beginning the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 46\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival\\r\\nat Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now\\r\\nbeen spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of\\r\\ntwo letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.\\r\\nElizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to\\r\\nenjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.  The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\\r\\nwritten five days ago.  The beginning contained an account of\\r\\nall their little parties and engagements, with such news as the\\r\\ncountry afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day\\r\\nlater, and written in evident agitation, gave more important\\r\\nintelligence.  It was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred\\r\\nof a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of\\r\\nalarming you-- be assured that we are all well.  What I have to\\r\\nsay relates to poor Lydia.  An express came at twelve last night,\\r\\n just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to\\r\\ninform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his\\r\\nofficers; to own the truth, with Wickham!  Imagine our surprise.\\r\\nTo Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.  I\\r\\nam very, very sorry.  So imprudent a match on both sides! But I\\r\\nam willing to hope the best, and that his character has been\\r\\nmisunderstood.  Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe\\r\\nhim, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad\\r\\nat heart.  His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know\\r\\nmy father can give her nothing.  Our poor mother is sadly\\r\\ngrieved.  My father bears it better.  How thankful am I that we\\r\\nnever let them know what has been said against him!  we must\\r\\nforget it ourselves.  They were off Saturday night about twelve,\\r\\nas is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\r\\neight.  The express was sent off directly.  My dear Lizzy, they\\r\\nmust have passed within ten miles of us.  Colonel Forster gives\\r\\nus reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his\\r\\nwife, informing her of their intention.  I must conclude, for I\\r\\ncannot be long from my poor mother.  I am afraid you will not\\r\\nbe able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely\\r\\nknowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly\\r\\nseized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read\\r\\nas follows:  it had been written a day later than the conclusion of\\r\\nthe first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\\r\\nletter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\\r\\nconfined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\\r\\nfor being coherent.  Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\\r\\nwrite, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\\r\\nImprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor\\r\\nLydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken\\r\\nplace, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\r\\nto Scotland.  Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left\\r\\nBrighton the day before, not many hours after the express.\\r\\nThough Lydia\\'s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand\\r\\nthat they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped\\r\\nby Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go\\r\\nthere, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel\\r\\nF., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to\\r\\ntrace their route.  He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no\\r\\nfurther; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\\r\\ncoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\\r\\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue\\r\\nthe London road.  I know not what to think.  After making\\r\\nevery possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on\\r\\ninto Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes,\\r\\nand at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--\\r\\nno such people had been seen to pass through.  With the kindest\\r\\nconcern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\\r\\nto us in a manner most creditable to his heart.  I am sincerely\\r\\ngrieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame\\r\\non them.  Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.  My father\\r\\nand mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.\\r\\nMany circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be\\r\\nmarried privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even\\r\\nif HE could form such a design against a young woman of\\r\\nLydia\\'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so\\r\\nlost to everything?  Impossible!  I grieve to find, however, that\\r\\nColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he\\r\\nshook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W.\\r\\nwas not a man to be trusted.  My poor mother is really ill, and\\r\\nkeeps her room.  Could she exert herself, it would be better; but\\r\\nthis is not to be expected.  And as to my father, I never in my\\r\\nlife saw him so affected.  Poor Kitty has anger for having\\r\\nconcealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,\\r\\none cannot wonder.  I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\\r\\nhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but\\r\\nnow, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your\\r\\nreturn?  I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\\r\\ninconvenient.  Adieu!  I take up my pen again to do what I\\r\\nhave just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that\\r\\nI cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as\\r\\npossible.  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\r\\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\\r\\nask of the former.  My father is going to London with Colonel\\r\\nForster instantly, to try to discover her.  What he means to do\\r\\nI am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow\\r\\nhim to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and\\r\\nColonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow\\r\\nevening.  In such and exigence, my uncle\\'s advice and assistance\\r\\nwould be everything in the world; he will immediately\\r\\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from\\r\\nher seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,\\r\\nwithout losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she\\r\\nreached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy\\r\\nappeared.  Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start,\\r\\nand before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose\\r\\nmind every idea was superseded by Lydia\\'s situation, hastily\\r\\nexclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.  I must\\r\\nfind Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be\\r\\ndelayed; I have not an instant to loose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling\\r\\nthan politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you\\r\\na minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.  You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she\\r\\nfelt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\\r\\nCalling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him,\\r\\nthough in so breathless an accent as made her almost\\r\\nunintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support\\r\\nherself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for\\r\\nDarcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of\\r\\ngentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid.  Is\\r\\nthere nothing you could take to give you present relief?  A\\r\\nglass of wine; shall I get you one?  You are very ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\\r\\n \"There is nothing the matter with me.  I am quite well; I am\\r\\nonly distressed by some dreadful news which I have just\\r\\nreceived from Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes\\r\\ncould not speak another word.  Darcy, in wretched suspense,\\r\\ncould only say something indistinctly of his concern, and\\r\\nobserve her in compassionate silence.  At length she spoke\\r\\nagain.  \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful\\r\\nnews. It cannot be concealed from any one.  My younger sister\\r\\nhas left all her friends-- has eloped; has thrown herself into the\\r\\npower of-- of Mr. Wickham.  They are gone off together from\\r\\nBrighton.  YOU know him too well to doubt the rest.  She has\\r\\nno money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to-- she\\r\\nis lost for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.  \"When I consider,\" she added\\r\\nin a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it!\\r\\nI, who knew what he was.  Had I but explained some part of\\r\\nit only-- some part of what I learnt, to my own family!  Had his\\r\\ncharacter been known, this could not have happened.  But it is\\r\\nall-- all too late now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved-- shocked.  But is\\r\\nit certain-- absolutely certain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and\\r\\nwere traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are\\r\\ncertainly not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover\\r\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my\\r\\nuncle\\'s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in\\r\\nhalf-an-hour.  But nothing can be done-- I know very well that\\r\\nnothing can be done.  How is such a man to be worked on?\\r\\nHow are they even to be discovered?  I have not the smallest\\r\\nhope.  It is every way horrible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When MY eyes were opened to his real character-- Oh! had I\\r\\nknown what I ought, what I dared to do!  But I knew not-- I\\r\\nwas afraid of doing too much.  Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and\\r\\nwas walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his\\r\\nbrow contracted, his air gloomy.  Elizabeth soon observed, and\\r\\ninstantly understood it.  Her power was sinking; everything\\r\\nMUST sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an\\r\\nassurance of the deepest disgrace.  She could neither wonder\\r\\nnor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\r\\nto her consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her\\r\\ndistress.  It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her\\r\\nunderstand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt\\r\\nthat she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be\\r\\nvain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.  Lydia--\\r\\nthe humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon\\r\\nswallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her\\r\\nhandkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and,\\r\\nafter a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of\\r\\nher situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner\\r\\nwhich, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint,\\r\\nsaid, \"I am afraid you have been  long desiring my absence, nor\\r\\nhave I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though\\r\\nunavailing concern.  Would to Heaven that anything could be\\r\\neither said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\\r\\nsuch distress!  But I will not torment you with vain wishes,\\r\\nwhich may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.  This\\r\\nunfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\\'s having the\\r\\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes.  Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.  Say\\r\\nthat urgent business calls us home immediately.  Conceal the\\r\\nunhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his\\r\\nsorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than\\r\\nthere was at present reason to hope, and leaving his\\r\\ncompliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting\\r\\nlook went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was\\r\\nthat they should ever see each other again on such terms of\\r\\ncordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire;\\r\\nand as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their\\r\\nacquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at\\r\\nthe perverseness of those feelings which would now have\\r\\npromoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in\\r\\nits termination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor\\r\\nfaulty.  But if otherwise-- if regard springing from such sources\\r\\nis unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often\\r\\ndescribed as arising on a first interview with its object, and even\\r\\nbefore two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in\\r\\nher defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the\\r\\nlatter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill\\r\\nsuccess might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less\\r\\ninteresting mode of attachment.  Be that as it may, she saw him\\r\\ngo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\'s infamy\\r\\nmust produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that\\r\\nwretched business.  Never, since reading Jane\\'s second letter,\\r\\nhad she entertained a hope of Wickham\\'s meaning to marry her.\\r\\nNo one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an\\r\\nexpectation.  Surprise was the least of her feelings on this\\r\\ndevelopment.  While the contents of the first letter remained in\\r\\nher mind, she was all surprise-- all astonishment that Wickham\\r\\nshould marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for\\r\\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had\\r\\nappeared incomprehensible.  But no it was all too natural. For\\r\\nsuch an attachment as this she might have sufficient charm; and\\r\\nthough she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in\\r\\nan elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her\\r\\nunderstanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in\\r\\nHertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was\\r\\nconvinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach\\r\\nherself to anybody.  Sometimes one officer, sometimes another,\\r\\nhad been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her\\r\\nopinion.  Her affections had continually been fluctuating but\\r\\nnever without an object.  The mischief of neglect and mistaken\\r\\nindulgence towards such a girl-- oh! how acutely did she now\\r\\nfeel it!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was wild to be at home-- to hear, to see, to be upon the\\r\\nspot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly\\r\\nupon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother\\r\\nincapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and\\r\\nthough almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia,\\r\\nher uncle\\'s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and\\r\\ntill he entered the room her impatience was severe.  Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the\\r\\nservant\\'s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\\r\\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated\\r\\nthe cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and\\r\\ndwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy,\\r\\nthough Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted.  Not Lydia\\r\\nonly, but all were concerned in it; and after the first\\r\\nexclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised\\r\\nevery assistance in his power.  Elizabeth, though expecting no\\r\\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being\\r\\nactuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was\\r\\nspeedily settled.  They were to be off as soon as possible.  \"But\\r\\nwhat is to be done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it\\r\\nso?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\\r\\nengagement.  THAT is all settled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her\\r\\nroom to prepare.  \"And are they upon such terms as for her to\\r\\ndisclose the real truth?  Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her\\r\\nin the hurry and confusion of the following hour.  Had Elizabeth\\r\\nbeen at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that\\r\\nall employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself;\\r\\nbut she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and\\r\\namongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their\\r\\nfriends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden\\r\\ndeparture.  An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and\\r\\nMr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn,\\r\\nnothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all\\r\\nthe misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of\\r\\ntime than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and\\r\\non the road to Longbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 47\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle,\\r\\nas they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious\\r\\nconsideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\\r\\nyour eldest sister does on the matter.  It appears to me so very\\r\\nunlikely that any young man should form such a design against\\r\\na girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who\\r\\nwas actually staying in his colonel\\'s family, that I am strongly\\r\\ninclined to hope the best.  Could he expect that her friends\\r\\nwould not step forward?  Could he expect to be noticed again\\r\\nby the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?  His\\r\\ntemptation is not adequate to the risk!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your\\r\\nuncle\\'s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,\\r\\nhonour, and interest, for him to be guilty of.  I cannot think so\\r\\nvery ill of Wickham.  Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give\\r\\nhim up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\r\\nneglect I can believe him capable.  If, indeed, it should be so!\\r\\nBut I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland\\r\\nif that had been the case?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute\\r\\nproof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\\r\\nsuch a presumption!  And, besides, no traces of them were to be\\r\\nfound on the Barnet road.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then-- supposing them to be in London.  They may be there,\\r\\nthough for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional\\r\\npurpose.  It is not likely that money should be very abundant on\\r\\neither side; and it might strike them that they could be more\\r\\neconomically, though less expeditiously, married in London\\r\\nthan in Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why all this secrecy?  Why any fear of detection?  Why must\\r\\ntheir marriage be private?  Oh, no, no-- this is not likely.  His\\r\\nmost particular friend, you see by Jane\\'s account, was\\r\\npersuaded of his never intending to marry her.  Wickham will\\r\\nnever marry a woman without some money.  He cannot afford\\r\\nit.  And what claims has Lydia-- what attraction has she beyond\\r\\nyouth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her\\r\\nsake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying\\r\\nwell?  As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the\\r\\ncorps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am\\r\\nnot able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a\\r\\nstep might produce.  But as to your other objection, I am afraid\\r\\nit will hardly hold good.  Lydia has no brothers to step forward;\\r\\nand he might imagine, from my father\\'s behaviour, from his\\r\\nindolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to\\r\\nwhat was going forward in his family, that HE would do as\\r\\nlittle, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such\\r\\na matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love\\r\\nof him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nwith tears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and\\r\\nvirtue in such a point should admit of doubt.  But, really, I\\r\\nknow not what to say.  Perhaps I am not doing her justice.  But\\r\\nshe is very young; she has never been taught to think on\\r\\nserious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a\\r\\ntwelvemonth-- she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\r\\nand vanity.  She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the\\r\\nmost idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that\\r\\ncame in her way.  Since the  ----shire were first quartered in\\r\\nMeryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in\\r\\nher head.  She has been doing everything in her power by\\r\\nthinking and talking on the subject, to give greater-- what shall\\r\\nI call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively\\r\\nenough.  And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\\r\\nperson and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very\\r\\nill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?  And who is there, whatever\\r\\nmight be their former conduct, that she would think capable of\\r\\nsuch an attempt, till it were proved against them?  But Jane\\r\\nknows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.  We both know\\r\\nthat he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he\\r\\nhas neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful\\r\\nas he is insinuating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\\r\\ncuriosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring.  \"I told you, the\\r\\nother day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you\\r\\nyourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he\\r\\nspoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and\\r\\nliberality towards him.  And there are other circumstances which\\r\\nI am not at liberty-- which it is not worth while to relate; but his\\r\\nlies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.  From what\\r\\nhe said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\r\\nreserved, disagreeable girl.  Yet he knew to the contrary himself.\\r\\nHe must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we\\r\\nhave found her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this?  can she be ignorant of\\r\\nwhat you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and\\r\\nsaw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.  And when I\\r\\nreturned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or\\r\\nfortnight\\'s time.  As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I\\r\\nrelated the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our\\r\\nknowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any\\r\\none, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of\\r\\nhim should then be overthrown?  And even when it was settled\\r\\nthat Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\\r\\nher eyes to his character never occurred to me.  That SHE could\\r\\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head.\\r\\nThat such a consequence as THIS could ensue, you may easily\\r\\nbelieve, was far enough from my thoughts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no\\r\\nreason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not the slightest.  I can remember no symptom of affection on\\r\\neither side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you\\r\\nmust be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be\\r\\nthrown away.  When first he entered the corps, she was ready\\r\\nenough to admire him; but so we all were.  Every girl in or near\\r\\nMeryton was out of her senses about him for the first two\\r\\nmonths; but he never distinguished HER by any particular\\r\\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of\\r\\nextravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way,\\r\\nand others of the regiment, who treated her with more\\r\\ndistinction, again became her favourites.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be\\r\\nadded to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting\\r\\nsubject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them\\r\\nfrom it long, during the whole of the journey.  From Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nthoughts it was never absent.  Fixed there by the keenest of all\\r\\nanguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or\\r\\nforgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one\\r\\nnight on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next\\r\\nday.  It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could\\r\\nnot have been wearied by long expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\\r\\nstanding on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;\\r\\nand, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise\\r\\nthat lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole\\r\\nbodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing\\r\\nearnest of their welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty\\r\\nkiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running\\r\\ndown from her mother\\'s apartment, immediately met her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled\\r\\nthe eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything\\r\\nhad been heard of the fugitives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane.  \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I\\r\\nhope everything will be well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have heard only twice.  He wrote me a few lines on\\r\\nWednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me\\r\\nhis directions, which I particularly begged him to do.  He merely\\r\\nadded that he should not write again till he had something of\\r\\nimportance to mention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my mother-- how is she?  How are you all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\\r\\ngreatly shaken.  She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction\\r\\nin seeing you all.  She does not yet leave her dressing-room.\\r\\nMary and Kitty are, thank Heaven, are quite well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you-- how are you?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"You look pale.\\r\\nHow much you must have gone through!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and\\r\\ntheir conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were engaged with their children,. Was now put an end\\r\\nto by the approach of the whole party.  Jane ran to her uncle and\\r\\naunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate\\r\\nsmiles and tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which\\r\\nElizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the\\r\\nothers, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to\\r\\ngive.  The sanguine hope of good, however, which the\\r\\nbenevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her;\\r\\nshe still expected that it would all end well, and that every\\r\\nmorning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her\\r\\nfather, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce\\r\\ntheir marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation together, received them exactly as might\\r\\nbe expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives\\r\\nagainst the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of\\r\\nher own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the\\r\\nperson to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her\\r\\ndaughter must principally be owing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going to\\r\\nBrighton, with all my family, THIS would not have happened;\\r\\nbut poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.  Why did\\r\\nthe Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?  I am sure there\\r\\nwas some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the\\r\\nkind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after.\\r\\nI always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her;\\r\\nbut I was overruled, as I always am.  Poor dear child!  And now\\r\\nhere\\'s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\r\\nWickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\\r\\nwhat is to become of us all?  The Collinses will turn us out\\r\\nbefore he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,\\r\\nbrother, I do not know what we shall do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\\r\\nafter general assurances of his affection for her and all her\\r\\nfamily, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,\\r\\nand would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering\\r\\nLydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is\\r\\nright to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look\\r\\non it a certain.  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\\r\\nIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we\\r\\nknow that they are not married, and have no design of marrying,\\r\\ndo not let us give the matter over as lost.  As soon as I get to\\r\\ntown I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with\\r\\nme to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as\\r\\nto what is to be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly\\r\\nwhat I could most wish for.  And now do, when you get to\\r\\ntown, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not\\r\\nmarried already, MAKE them marry.  And as for wedding\\r\\nclothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall\\r\\nhave as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they\\r\\nare married.  And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\\r\\nTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out\\r\\nof my wits-- and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all\\r\\nover me-- such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and\\r\\nsuch beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.\\r\\nAnd tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her\\r\\nclothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are\\r\\nthe best warehouses.  Oh, brother, how kind you are!  I know\\r\\nyou will contrive it all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest\\r\\nendeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending\\r\\nmoderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after\\r\\ntalking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they\\r\\nall left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who\\r\\nattended in the absence of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\\r\\nreal occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not\\r\\nattempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence\\r\\nenough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they\\r\\nwaited at table, and judged it better that ONE only of the\\r\\nhousehold, and the one whom they could most trust should\\r\\ncomprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty,\\r\\nwho had been  too busily engaged in their separate apartments\\r\\nto make their appearance before.  One came from her books,\\r\\nand the other from her toilette.  The faces of both, however,\\r\\nwere tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except\\r\\nthat the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had\\r\\nherself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness\\r\\nthan usual to the accents of Kitty.  As for Mary, she was\\r\\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a\\r\\ncountenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at\\r\\ntable:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much\\r\\ntalked of.  But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into\\r\\nthe wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly\\r\\nconsolation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she\\r\\nadded, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw\\r\\nfrom it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is\\r\\nirretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;\\r\\nthat her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that\\r\\nshe cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the\\r\\nundeserving of the other sex.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much\\r\\noppressed to make any reply.  Mary, however, continued to\\r\\nconsole herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil\\r\\nbefore them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\r\\nhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed\\r\\nherself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane\\r\\nwas equally eager to satisfy.  After joining in general\\r\\nlamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which\\r\\nElizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could\\r\\nnot assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the\\r\\nsubject, by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which\\r\\nI have not already heard.  Give me further particulars.  What did\\r\\nColonel Forster say?  Had they no apprehension of anything\\r\\nbefore the elopement took place?  They must have seen them\\r\\ntogether for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\\r\\npartiality, especially on Lydia\\'s side, but nothing to give him any\\r\\nalarm.  I am so grieved for him!  His behaviour was attentive and\\r\\nkind to the utmost.  He WAS coming to us, in order to assure us\\r\\nof his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to\\r\\nScotland:  when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened\\r\\nhis journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?\\r\\nDid he know of their intending to go off?  Had Colonel Forster\\r\\nseen Denny himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by HIM, Denny denied knowing\\r\\nanything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion\\r\\nabout it.  He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\\r\\nmarrying-- and from THAT, I am inclined to hope, he might\\r\\nhave been misunderstood before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\\r\\nentertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?\\r\\nI felt a little uneasy-- a little fearful of my sister\\'s happiness with\\r\\nhim in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been\\r\\nalways quite right.  My father and mother knew nothing of that;\\r\\nthey only felt how imprudent a match it must be.  Kitty then\\r\\nowned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the\\r\\nrest of us, that in Lydia\\'s last letter she had prepared her for\\r\\nsuch a step.  She had known, it seems, of their being in love with\\r\\neach other, many weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham\\r\\nhimself?  Does he know he real character?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he\\r\\nformerly did.  He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\\r\\nAnd since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left\\r\\nMeryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew\\r\\nof him, this could not have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister.  \"But to\\r\\nexpose the former faults of any person without knowing what\\r\\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.  We acted with\\r\\nthe best intentions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\'s note to\\r\\nhis wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\\r\\nThese were the contents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,--\\r\\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot\\r\\nhelp laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as\\r\\nsoon as I am missed.  I am going to Gretna Green, and if you\\r\\ncannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there\\r\\nis but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.  I should\\r\\nnever be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.  You\\r\\nneed not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do\\r\\nnot like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write\\r\\nto them and sign my name \\'Lydia Wickham.\\'  What a good joke\\r\\nit will be!  I can hardly write for laughing.  Pray make my\\r\\nexcuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing\\r\\nwith him to-night.  Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he\\r\\nknows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we\\r\\nmeet, with great pleasure.  I shall send for my clothes when I\\r\\nget to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a\\r\\ngreat slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.\\r\\nGood-bye.  Give my love to Colonel Forster.  I hope you will\\r\\ndrink to our good journey.  Your affectionate friend,\\r\\n                              \"Lydia Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she\\r\\nhad finished it.  What a letter is this, to be written at such a\\r\\nmoment!  But at least it shows that SHE was serious on the\\r\\nsubject of their journey.  Whatever he might afterwards\\r\\npersuade her to, it was not on her side a SCHEME of\\r\\ninfamy.  My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI never saw any one so shocked.  He could not speak a word\\r\\nfor full ten minutes.  My mother was taken ill immediately, and\\r\\nthe whole house in such confusion!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it\\r\\nwho did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  I hope there was.  But to be guarded at such a\\r\\ntime is very difficult.  My mother was in hysterics, and though I\\r\\nendeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am\\r\\nafraid I did not do so much as I might have done!  But the\\r\\nhorror of what might possibly happen almost took from me\\r\\nmy faculties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.  You do\\r\\nnot look well.  Oh that I had been with you!  you have had every\\r\\ncare and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\\r\\nevery fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of\\r\\nthem.  Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,\\r\\nthat her hours of repose should not be broken in on.  My aunt\\r\\nPhillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went\\r\\naway; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.  She\\r\\nwas of great use and comfort to us all.  And Lady Lucas has\\r\\nbeen very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\\r\\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her\\r\\ndaughters\\', if they should be of use to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps\\r\\nshe MEANT well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one\\r\\ncannot see too little of one\\'s neighbours.  Assistance is\\r\\nimpossible; condolence insufferable.  Let them triumph over us\\r\\nat a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her\\r\\nfather had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of\\r\\nhis daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He meant I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place\\r\\nwhere they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if\\r\\nanything could be made out from them.  His principal object\\r\\nmust be to discover the number of the hackney coach which\\r\\ntook them from Clapham.  It had come with a fare from\\r\\nLondon; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\\r\\ngentleman and lady\\'s removing from one carriage into another\\r\\nmight be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.  If\\r\\nhe could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had\\r\\nbefore set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there,\\r\\nand hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and\\r\\nnumber of the coach.  I do not know of any other designs that\\r\\nhe had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his\\r\\nspirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\\r\\nout even so much as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 48\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the\\r\\nnext morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line\\r\\nfrom him.  His family knew him to be, on all common occasions,\\r\\na most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time\\r\\nthey had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that\\r\\nhe had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of THAT they\\r\\nwould have been glad to be certain.  Mr. Gardiner had waited\\r\\nonly for the letters before he set off.\\r\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving\\r\\nconstant information of what was going on, and their uncle\\r\\npromised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\\r\\nLongbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his\\r\\nsister, who considered it as the only security for her husband\\'s\\r\\nnot being killed in a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire\\r\\na few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be\\r\\nserviceable to her nieces.  She shared in their attendance on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of\\r\\nfreedom.  Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and\\r\\nalways, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening\\r\\nthem up-- though, as she never came without reporting some\\r\\nfresh instance of Wickham\\'s extravagance or irregularity, she\\r\\nseldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than\\r\\nshe found them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\\r\\nmonths before, had been almost an angel of light.  He was\\r\\ndeclared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his\\r\\nintrigues all honoured with the title of seduction, had been\\r\\nextended into every tradesman\\'s family.  Everybody declared\\r\\nthat he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\\r\\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted\\r\\nthe appearance of his goodness.  Elizabeth, though she did not\\r\\ncredit above half of what was said, believed enough to make\\r\\nher former assurance of her sister\\'s ruin more certain; and even\\r\\nJane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more\\r\\nespecially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to\\r\\nScotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they\\r\\nmust in all probability have gained some news of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife\\r\\nreceived a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he\\r\\nhad immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to\\r\\ncome to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to\\r\\nEpsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining\\r\\nany satisfactory information; and that he was now determined\\r\\nto inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\\r\\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on\\r\\ntheir first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.\\r\\nMr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this\\r\\nmeasure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist\\r\\nhim in pursuing it.  He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly\\r\\ndisinclined at present to leave London and promised to write\\r\\nagain very soon.  There was also a postscript to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\r\\npossible, from some of the young man\\'s intimates in the\\r\\nregiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections\\r\\nwho would be likely to know in what part of town he has now\\r\\nconcealed himself.  If there were any one that one could apply\\r\\nto with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be\\r\\nof essential consequence.  At present we have nothing to guide\\r\\nus.  Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power\\r\\nto satisfy us on this head.  But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\\r\\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than\\r\\nany other person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this\\r\\ndeference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her\\r\\npower to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the\\r\\ncompliment deserved.  She had never heard of his having had\\r\\nany relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had\\r\\nbeen dead many years.  It was possible, however, that some of\\r\\nhis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more\\r\\ninformation; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\\r\\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\\r\\nanxious part of each was when the post was expected.  The\\r\\narrival of letters was the grand object of every morning\\'s\\r\\nimpatience.  Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be\\r\\ntold would be communicated, and every succeeding day was\\r\\nexpected to bring some news of importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived\\r\\nfor their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;\\r\\nwhich, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for\\r\\nhim in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who\\r\\nknew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her,\\r\\nand read it likewise. It was s follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--\\r\\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in\\r\\nlife, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\\r\\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\\r\\nfrom Hertfordshire.  Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins\\r\\nand myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your\\r\\nrespectable family, in your present distress, which must be of\\r\\nthe bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no\\r\\n time can remove.  No arguments shall be wanting on my part\\r\\nthat can alleviate so severe a misfortune-- or that may comfort\\r\\nyou, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most\\r\\nafflicting to a parent\\'s mind.  The death of your daughter would\\r\\nhave been a blessing in comparison of  this.  And it is the more\\r\\nto be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear\\r\\nCharlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in\\r\\nyour daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;\\r\\nthough, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition\\r\\nmust be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an\\r\\nenormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are\\r\\ngrievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by\\r\\nMrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter,\\r\\nto whom I have related the affair.  They agree with me in\\r\\napprehending that this false step in one daughter will be\\r\\ninjurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves\\r\\nwith such a family?  And this consideration leads me moreover\\r\\nto reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last\\r\\nNovember; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\\r\\nin all your sorrow and disgrace.  Let me then advise you, dear\\r\\nsir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your\\r\\nunworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\\r\\nreap the fruits of her own heinous offense.-- I am, dear sir, etc.,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\\r\\nfrom Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant\\r\\nnature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single\\r\\nrelationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was\\r\\ncertain that he had no  near one living.  His former\\r\\nacquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the\\r\\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular\\r\\nfriendship with any of them.  There was no one, therefore, who\\r\\ncould be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.  And in\\r\\nthe wretched state of his own finances, there was a very\\r\\npowerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery\\r\\nby Lydia\\'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left\\r\\ngaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\\r\\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.  He owed\\r\\na good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\\r\\nformidable.  Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these\\r\\nparticulars from the Longbourn family.  Jane heard them with\\r\\nhorror.  \"A gamester!\" she cried.  \"This is wholly unexpected.\\r\\nI had not an idea of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see\\r\\ntheir father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\\r\\nRendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he\\r\\nhad yielded to his brother-in-law\\'s entreaty that he would return\\r\\nto his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might\\r\\nsuggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.  When Mrs.\\r\\nBennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction\\r\\nas her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his\\r\\nlife had been before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she cried.\\r\\n\"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.  Who\\r\\nis to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes\\r\\naway?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled\\r\\nthat she and the children should go to London, at the same time\\r\\nthat Mr. Bennet came from it.  The coach, therefore, took them\\r\\nthe first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to\\r\\nLongbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth\\r\\nand her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part\\r\\nof the world.  His name had never been voluntarily mentioned\\r\\nbefore them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter\\r\\nfrom him, had ended in nothing.  Elizabeth had received none\\r\\nsince her return that could come from Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other\\r\\nexcuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing,\\r\\ntherefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though\\r\\nElizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with\\r\\nher own feelings, was perfectly  aware that, had she known\\r\\nnothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia\\'s\\r\\ninfamy somewhat better.  It would have spared her, she thought,\\r\\none sleepless night out of two.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\r\\nphilosophic composure.  He said as little as he had ever been in\\r\\nthe habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had\\r\\ntaken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had\\r\\ncourage to speak of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,\\r\\nthat Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on\\r\\nher briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have\\r\\nendured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that.  Who should suffer\\r\\nbut myself?  It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil.  Human nature is\\r\\nso prone to fall into it!  No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel\\r\\nhow much I have been to blame.  I am not afraid of being\\r\\noverpowered by the impression.  It will pass away soon enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is happy then,\" said her father drily; \"and her residence\\r\\nthere will probably be of some duration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen after a short silence he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to\\r\\nme last May, which, considering the event, shows some\\r\\ngreatness of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\\r\\nmother\\'s tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a parade,\" he cried, \"which does one good; it gives such\\r\\nan elegance to misfortune!  Another day I will do the same; I\\r\\nwill sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and\\r\\ngive as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till\\r\\nKitty runs away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not going to run away, papa,\" said Kitty fretfully.  \"If I\\r\\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU go to Brighton.  I would not trust you so near it as\\r\\nEastbourne for fifty pounds!  No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to\\r\\nbe cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.  No officer is ever\\r\\nto enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the\\r\\nvillage.  Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up\\r\\nwith one of your sisters.  And you are never to stir out of doors\\r\\ntill you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day\\r\\nin a rational manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy.  If you\\r\\nare a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review\\r\\nat the end of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 49\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet\\'s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\\r\\nwalking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw\\r\\nthe housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she\\r\\ncame to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her;\\r\\nbut, instead of the expected summons, when they approached\\r\\nher, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon, madam, for\\r\\ninterrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\\r\\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Hill?  We have heard nothing from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \"don\\'t\\r\\nyou know there is an express come for master from Mr.\\r\\nGardiner?  He has been here this half-hour, and master has had\\r\\na letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\\r\\nThey ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from\\r\\nthence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were\\r\\non the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when\\r\\nthey were met by the butler, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma\\'am, he is walking\\r\\ntowards the little copse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall\\r\\nonce more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was\\r\\ndeliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side\\r\\nof the paddock.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running\\r\\nas Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for\\r\\nbreath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, papa, what news-- what news?  Have you heard from my\\r\\nuncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring-- good or bad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the\\r\\nletter from his pocket.  \"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.  Jane now came\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know myself what\\r\\nit is about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                    \"Gracechurch Street, Monday,\"\\r\\n                              \"August 2.\\r\\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,--\\r\\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and\\r\\nsuch as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.\\r\\nSoon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to\\r\\nfind out in what part of London they were.  The particulars I\\r\\nreserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.\\r\\nI have seen them both-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it is as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth read on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen them both.  They are not married, nor can I find\\r\\nthere was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to\\r\\nperform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\\r\\nyour side, I hope it will not be long before they are.  All that is\\r\\nrequired of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\\r\\nequal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your\\r\\nchildren after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\r\\nmoreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during\\r\\nyour life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\r\\nwhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\\r\\nwith, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.  I shall send\\r\\nthis by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your\\r\\nanswer.  You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,\\r\\nthat Mr. Wickham\\'s circumstances are not so hopeless as they\\r\\nare generally believed to be.  The world has been deceived in\\r\\nthat respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little\\r\\nmoney, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my\\r\\nniece, in addition to her own fortune.  If, as I conclude will be\\r\\nthe case, you send me full powers to act in your name\\r\\nthroughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give\\r\\ndirections to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.\\r\\nThere will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town\\r\\nagain; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my\\r\\ndiligence and care.  Send back your answer as fast as you can,\\r\\nand be careful to write explicitly.  We have judged it best that\\r\\nmy niece should be married from this house, of which I hope\\r\\nyou will approve.  She comes to us to-day.  I shall write again as\\r\\nsoon as anything more is determined on.  Yours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"EDW. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it possible?\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.  \"Can it\\r\\nbe possible that he will marry her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\" said\\r\\nher sister.  \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" cried Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMost earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time\\r\\nbefore he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back and write\\r\\nimmediately.  Consider how important every moment is in such\\r\\na case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards\\r\\nthe house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And may I ask--\" said Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I suppose,\\r\\nmust be complied with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Complied with!  I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they MUST marry!  Yet he is SUCH a man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry.  There is nothing else to be done.\\r\\nBut there are two things that I want very much to know; one is,\\r\\nhow much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about;\\r\\nand the other, how am I ever to pay him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Money!  My uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so\\r\\nslight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and\\r\\nfifty after I am gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred\\r\\nto me before.  His debts to be discharged, and something still to\\r\\nremain!  Oh! it must be my uncle\\'s doings!  Generous, good\\r\\nman, I am afraid he has distressed himself.  A small sum could\\r\\nnot do all this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham\\'s a fool if he takes her with a\\r\\nfarthing less than ten thousand pounds.  I should be sorry to\\r\\nthink so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten thousand pounds!  Heaven forbid!  How is half such a\\r\\nsum to be repaid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\\r\\ncontinued silent till they reached the house.  Their father then\\r\\nwent on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the\\r\\nbreakfast-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon\\r\\nas they were by themselves.  \"How strange this is!  And for\\r\\nTHIS we are to be thankful.  That they should marry, small as\\r\\nis their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character,\\r\\nwe are forced to rejoice.  Oh, Lydia!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly\\r\\nwould not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.\\r\\nThough our kind uncle has done something towards clearing\\r\\nhim, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like\\r\\nit, has been advanced.  He has children of his own, and may\\r\\nhave more.  How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham\\'s debts have been,\"\\r\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our\\r\\nsister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for\\r\\nthem, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.  The\\r\\nkindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.  Their\\r\\ntaking her home, and affording her their personal protection and\\r\\ncountenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of\\r\\ngratitude cannot enough acknowledge.  By this time she is\\r\\nactually with them!  If such goodness does not make her\\r\\nmiserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!  What a\\r\\nmeeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\"\\r\\nsaid Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy.  His\\r\\nconsenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come\\r\\nto a right way of thinking.  Their mutual affection will steady\\r\\nthem; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in\\r\\nso rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence\\r\\nforgotten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither\\r\\nyou, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.  It is useless to talk of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all\\r\\nlikelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.  They went\\r\\nto the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would\\r\\nnot wish them to make it known to her.  He was writing and,\\r\\nwithout raising his head, coolly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May we take my uncle\\'s letter to read to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went\\r\\nupstairs together.  Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:\\r\\none communication would, therefore, do for all.  After a slight\\r\\npreparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet could hardly contain herself.  As soon as Jane had read\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s hope of Lydia\\'s  being soon married, her joy\\r\\nburst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\r\\nexuberance.  She was now in an irritation as violent from\\r\\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.\\r\\nTo know that her daughter would be married was enough.  She\\r\\nwas disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any\\r\\nremembrance of her misconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried.  \"This is delightful indeed!\\r\\nShe will be married!  I shall see her again!  She will be married at\\r\\nsixteen!  My good, kind brother!  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nknew he would manage everything!  How I long to see her!  and\\r\\nto see dear Wickham too!  But the clothes, the wedding clothes!\\r\\nI will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.  Lizzy,\\r\\nmy dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will\\r\\ngive her.  Stay, stay, I will go myself.  Ring the bell, Kitty, for\\r\\nHill.  I will put on my things in a moment.  My dear, dear Lydia!\\r\\nHow merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the\\r\\nviolence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the\\r\\nobligations which Mr. Gardiner\\'s behaviour laid them all under.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a\\r\\ngreat measure to his kindness.  We are persuaded that he has\\r\\npledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it\\r\\nbut her own uncle?  If he had not had a family of his own, I and\\r\\nmy children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the\\r\\nfirst time we have ever had anything from him, except a few\\r\\npresents.  Well!  I am so happy!  In a short time I shall have a\\r\\ndaughter married.  Mrs. Wickham!  How well it sounds!  And\\r\\nshe was only sixteen last June.  My dear Jane, I am in such a\\r\\nflutter, that I am sure I can\\'t write; so I will dictate, and you\\r\\nwrite for me.  We will settle with your father about the money\\r\\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,\\r\\nand cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very\\r\\nplentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty,\\r\\npersuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be\\r\\nconsulted.  One day\\'s delay, she observed, would be of small\\r\\nimportance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so\\r\\nobstinate as usual.  Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and\\r\\ntell the good, good news to my sister Philips.  And as I come\\r\\nback, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.  Kitty, run down\\r\\nand order the carriage.  An airing would do me a great deal of\\r\\ngood, I am sure.  Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?\\r\\nOh!  Here comes Hill!  My dear Hill, have you heard the good\\r\\nnews?  Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have\\r\\na bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.  Elizabeth received\\r\\nher congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly,\\r\\ntook refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Lydia\\'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it\\r\\nwas no worse, she had need to be thankful.  She felt it so; and\\r\\nthough, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor\\r\\nworldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in\\r\\nlooking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she\\r\\nfelt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 50\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\\r\\nthat, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\\r\\nannual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\\r\\nwife, if she survived him.  He now wished it more than ever.\\r\\nHad he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been\\r\\nindebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could\\r\\nnow be purchased for her.  The satisfaction of prevailing on one\\r\\nof the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her\\r\\nhusband might then have rested in its proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\\r\\nanyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\\r\\nbrother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\\r\\nthe extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as\\r\\nsoon as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\\r\\nperfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.  The\\r\\nson was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be\\r\\nof age, and the widow and younger children would by that\\r\\nmeans be provided for.  Five daughters successively entered the\\r\\nworld, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many\\r\\nyears after Lydia\\'s birth, had been certain that he would.  This\\r\\nevent had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be\\r\\nsaving.  Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\\r\\nhusband\\'s love of independence had alone prevented their\\r\\nexceeding their income.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet and the children.  But in what proportions it should be\\r\\ndivided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\\r\\nThis was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was\\r\\nnow to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\\r\\nacceding to the proposal before him.  In terms of grateful\\r\\nacknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\\r\\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\r\\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\r\\nengagements that had been made for him.  He had never before\\r\\nsupposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\\r\\ndaughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\\r\\nhimself as by the present arrangement.  He would scarcely be\\r\\nten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid\\r\\nthem; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the\\r\\ncontinual presents in money which passed to her through her\\r\\nmother\\'s hands, Lydia\\'s expenses had been very little within\\r\\nthat sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\\r\\ntoo, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\\r\\nwas to have as little trouble in the business as possible.  When\\r\\nthe first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\\r\\nseeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\\r\\nindolence.  His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\\r\\nin undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.  He\\r\\nbegged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to\\r\\nhis brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message\\r\\nto her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with\\r\\nproportionate speed through the neighbourhood.  It was borne\\r\\nin the latter with decent philosophy.  To be sure, it would have\\r\\nbeen more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia\\r\\nBennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,\\r\\nbeen secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse.  But\\r\\nthere was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\\r\\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded\\r\\nbefore from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little\\r\\nof their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such\\r\\nan husband her misery was considered certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\\r\\nthis happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\\r\\nand in spirits oppressively high.  No sentiment of shame gave a\\r\\ndamp to her triumph.  The marriage of a daughter, which had\\r\\nbeen the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was\\r\\nnow on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her\\r\\nwords ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine\\r\\nmuslins, new carriages, and servants.  She was busily searching\\r\\nthrough the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her\\r\\ndaughter, and, without knowing of considering what their\\r\\nincome might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--\\r\\nor the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;\\r\\nbut Ashworth is too far off!  I could not bear to have her ten\\r\\nmiles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while\\r\\nthe servants remained.  But when they had withdrawn, he said\\r\\nto her: \"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses\\r\\nfor your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.\\r\\nInto ONE house in this neighbourhood they shall never have\\r\\nadmittance.  I will not encourage the impudence of either, by\\r\\nreceiving them at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\\r\\nfirm.  It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\\r\\namazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a\\r\\nguinea to buy clothes for his daughter.  He protested that she\\r\\nshould receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the\\r\\noccasion.  Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.  That his\\r\\nanger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\r\\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which\\r\\nher marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could\\r\\nbelieve possible.  She was more alive to the disgrace which her\\r\\nwant of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\\'s nuptials, than\\r\\nto any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a\\r\\nfortnight before they took place.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the\\r\\ndistress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted\\r\\nwith their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would\\r\\nso shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they\\r\\nmight hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those\\r\\nwho were not immediately on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\\r\\nThere were few people on whose secrecy she would have more\\r\\nconfidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one\\r\\nwhose knowledge of a sister\\'s frailty would have mortified her\\r\\nso much-- not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it\\r\\nindividually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf\\r\\nimpassable between them.  Had Lydia\\'s marriage been\\r\\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be\\r\\nsupposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family\\r\\nwhere, to every other objection, would now be added an\\r\\nalliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom\\r\\nhe so justly scorned.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From such a connection she could not wonder that he would\\r\\nshrink.  The wish of procuring her regard, which she had\\r\\nassured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational\\r\\nexpectation survive such a blow as this.  She was humbled, she\\r\\nwas grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.\\r\\nShe became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer\\r\\nhope to be benefited by it.  She wanted to hear of him, when\\r\\nthere seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.  She was\\r\\nconvinced that she could have been happy with him, when it\\r\\nwas no longer likely they should meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know\\r\\nthat the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four\\r\\nmonths ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully\\r\\nreceived!  He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most\\r\\ngenerous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a\\r\\ntriumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man\\r\\nwho, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have\\r\\nanswered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to\\r\\nthe advantage of both: by her ease and liveliness, his mind might\\r\\nhave been softened, his manners improved; and from his\\r\\njudgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\\r\\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring\\r\\nmultitude what connubial felicity really was.  An union of a\\r\\ndifferent tendency ,and precluding the possibility of the other,\\r\\nwas soon to be formed in their family.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\\r\\nindependence, she could not imagine.  But how little of\\r\\npermanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only\\r\\nbrought together because their passions were stronger than their\\r\\nvirtue, she could easily conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.  To Mr. Bennet\\'s\\r\\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his\\r\\neagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and\\r\\nconcluded with entreaties that the subject might never be\\r\\nmentioned to him again.  The principal purport of his letter was\\r\\nto inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the\\r\\nmilitia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as\\r\\nsoon as his marriage was fixed on.  And I think you will agree\\r\\nwith me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly\\r\\nadvisable, both on his account and my niece\\'s.  It is Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s intention to go into the regulars; and among his\\r\\nformer friends, there are still some who are able and willing to\\r\\nassist him in the army.  He has the promise of an ensigncy in\\r\\nGeneral ----\\'s regiment, now quartered in the North.  It is an\\r\\nadvantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.  He\\r\\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they\\r\\nmay each have a character to preserve, they will both be more\\r\\nprudent.  I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our\\r\\npresent arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the\\r\\nvarious creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with\\r\\nassurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.\\r\\nAnd will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar\\r\\nassurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a\\r\\nlist according to his information?  He has given in all his debts; I\\r\\nhope at least he has not deceived us.  Haggerston has our\\r\\ndirections, and all will be completed in a week.  They will then\\r\\njoin his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and\\r\\nI understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous\\r\\nof seeing you all before she leaves the South.  She is well, and\\r\\nbegs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.--\\r\\nYours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"E. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of\\r\\nWickham\\'s removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr.\\r\\nGardiner could do.  But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased\\r\\nwith it.  Lydia\\'s being settled in the North, just when she had\\r\\nexpected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had\\r\\nby no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nwas a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity\\r\\nthat Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was\\r\\nacquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster, \"said she, \"it will be quite\\r\\nshocking to send her away!  And there are several of the young\\r\\nmen, too, that she likes very much.  The officers may not be so\\r\\npleasant in General ----\\'s regiment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis daughter\\'s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\r\\nadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\r\\nreceived at first an absolute negative.  But Jane and Elizabeth,\\r\\nwho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\'s feelings and\\r\\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her\\r\\nparents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly,\\r\\nto receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they\\r\\nwere married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought,\\r\\nand act as they wished.  And their mother had the satisfaction\\r\\nof knowing that she would be able to show her married\\r\\ndaughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the\\r\\nNorth.  When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,\\r\\nhe sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that\\r\\nas soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to\\r\\nLongbourn.  Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham\\r\\nshould consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only\\r\\nher own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the\\r\\nlast object of her wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 51\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEIR sister\\'s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt\\r\\nfor her probably more than she felt for herself.  The carriage\\r\\nwas sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by\\r\\ndinner-time.  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss\\r\\nBennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings\\r\\nwhich would have attended herself, had she been the culprit,\\r\\nand was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came.  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\\r\\nreceive them.  Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the\\r\\ncarriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably\\r\\ngrave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown\\r\\nopen, and she ran into the room.  Her mother stepped forwards,\\r\\nembraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand,\\r\\nwith an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady;\\r\\nand wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt\\r\\nof their happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned,\\r\\nwas not quite so cordial.  His countenance rather gained in\\r\\nausterity; and he scarcely opened his lips.  The easy\\r\\nassurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke\\r\\nhim.  Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was\\r\\nshocked.  Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild,\\r\\nnoisy, and fearless.  She turned from sister to sister,\\r\\ndemanding their congratulations; and when at length they all\\r\\nsat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some\\r\\nlittle alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it\\r\\nwas a great while since she had been there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his\\r\\nmanners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his\\r\\nmarriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy\\r\\naddress, while he claimed their relationship, would have\\r\\ndelighted them all.  Elizabeth had not before believed him\\r\\nquite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving\\r\\nwithin herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of\\r\\nan impudent man.  She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\\r\\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no\\r\\nvariation of colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no want of discourse.  The bride and her mother could\\r\\nneither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to\\r\\nsit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in\\r\\nthat neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt\\r\\nvery unable to equal in her replies.  They seemed each of them\\r\\nto have the happiest memories in the world.  Nothing of the\\r\\npast was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to\\r\\nsubjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I\\r\\nwent away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there\\r\\nhave been things enough happened in the time.  Good gracious!\\r\\nwhen I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married\\r\\ntill I came back again!  though I thought it would be very good\\r\\nfun if I was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father lifted up his eyes.  Jane was distressed.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlooked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw\\r\\nany thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,\\r\\n\"Oh!  mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married\\r\\nto-day?  I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William\\r\\nGoulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know\\r\\nit, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off\\r\\nmy glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so\\r\\nthat he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\\r\\nany thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer.  She got up, and ran out of\\r\\nthe room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing\\r\\nthrough the hall to the dining parlour.  She then joined them\\r\\nsoon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her\\r\\nmother\\'s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,\\r\\n\"Ah!  Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower,\\r\\nbecause I am a married woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that\\r\\nembarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\\r\\nHer ease and good spirits increased.  She longed to see Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to\\r\\nhear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\" by each of them; and in the\\r\\nmean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring, and boast of\\r\\nbeing married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the\\r\\nbreakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband?  Is not\\r\\nhe a charming man?  I am sure my sisters must all envy me.  I\\r\\nonly hope they may have half my good luck.  They must all go to\\r\\nBrighton.  That is the place to get husbands.  What a pity it\\r\\nis, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.  But my dear\\r\\nLydia, I don\\'t at all like your going such a way off.  Must it\\r\\nbe so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  yes; -- there is nothing in that.  I shall like it\\r\\nof all things.  You and papa, and my sisters, must come down\\r\\nand see us.  We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I\\r\\ndare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get\\r\\ngood partners for them all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like it beyond any thing!\" said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\\r\\nsisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for\\r\\nthem before the winter is over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.\\r\\nMr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London,\\r\\nand he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so\\r\\nshort; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with\\r\\nher daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These\\r\\nparties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was\\r\\neven more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had\\r\\nexpected to find it; not equal to Lydia\\'s for him.  She had\\r\\nscarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from\\r\\nthe reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on\\r\\nby the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would\\r\\nhave wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose\\r\\nto elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his\\r\\nflight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\r\\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an\\r\\nopportunity of having a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him.  He was her dear Wickham on\\r\\nevery occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.\\r\\nHe did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would\\r\\nkill more birds on the first of September, than any body else\\r\\nin the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with\\r\\nher two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe.\\r\\nYou were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\\r\\nAre not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too\\r\\nlittle said on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!  You are so strange!  But I must tell you how it went off.\\r\\nWe were married, you know, at St. Clement\\'s, because Wickham\\'s\\r\\nlodgings were in that parish.  And it was settled that we\\r\\nshould all be there by eleven o\\'clock.  My uncle and aunt and I\\r\\nwere to go together; and the others were to meet us at the\\r\\nchurch.  Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!\\r\\nI was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put\\r\\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.  And\\r\\nthere was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and\\r\\ntalking away just as if she was reading a sermon.  However, I\\r\\ndid not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may\\r\\nsuppose, of my dear Wickham.  I longed to know whether he would\\r\\nbe married in his blue coat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it\\r\\nwould never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand,\\r\\nthat my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I\\r\\nwas with them.  If you\\'ll believe me, I did not once put my\\r\\nfoot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.  Not one\\r\\nparty, or scheme, or any thing.  To be sure London was rather\\r\\nthin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.  Well, and so\\r\\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away\\r\\nupon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.  And then, you\\r\\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it.\\r\\nWell, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my\\r\\nuncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we\\r\\ncould not be married all day.  But, luckily, he came back again\\r\\nin ten minutes\\' time, and then we all set out.  However, I\\r\\nrecollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going,\\r\\nthe wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done\\r\\nas well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! -- he was to come there with Wickham, you know, But\\r\\ngracious me!  I quite forgot!  I ought not to have said a word\\r\\nabout it.  I promised them so faithfully!  What will Wickham\\r\\nsay?  It was to be such a secret!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on\\r\\nthe subject.  You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with\\r\\ncuriosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly\\r\\ntell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it\\r\\nout of her power, by running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at\\r\\nleast it was impossible not to try for information.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad been at her sister\\'s wedding.  It was exactly a scene, and\\r\\nexactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and\\r\\nleast temptation to go.  Conjectures as to the meaning of it,\\r\\nrapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied\\r\\nwith none.  Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct\\r\\nin the noblest light, seemed most improbable.  She could not\\r\\nbear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote\\r\\na short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\\r\\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which\\r\\nhad been intended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity\\r\\nmust be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\\r\\n(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have\\r\\nbeen amongst you at such a time.  Pray write instantly, and let\\r\\nme understand it -- unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to\\r\\nremain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and\\r\\nthen I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not that I shall, though,\" she added to herself, as she\\r\\nfinished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me\\r\\nin an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks\\r\\nand stratagems to find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane\\'s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\r\\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was\\r\\nglad of it; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would\\r\\nreceive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a\\r\\nconfidante.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 52\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her\\r\\nletter as soon as she possibly could.  She was no sooner in\\r\\npossession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where\\r\\nshe was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of\\r\\nthe benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the\\r\\nletter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR NIECE,\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\r\\nmorning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing\\r\\nwill not comprise what I have to tell you.  I must confess\\r\\nmyself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from\\r\\nyou.  Don\\'t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let\\r\\nyou know that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary\\r\\non your side.  If you do not choose to understand me, forgive\\r\\nmy impertinence.  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am --\\r\\nand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned\\r\\nwould have allowed him to act as he has done.  But if you are\\r\\nreally innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.  On the\\r\\nvery day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a\\r\\nmost unexpected visitor.  Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up\\r\\nwith him several hours.  It was all over before I arrived; so\\r\\nmy curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your\\'s seems to\\r\\nhave been.  He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out\\r\\nwhere your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen\\r\\nand talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\\r\\nFrom what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\\r\\nourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\r\\nthem.  The motive professed was his conviction of its being\\r\\nowing to himself that Wickham\\'s worthlessness had not been so\\r\\nwell known as to make it impossible for any young woman of\\r\\ncharacter to love or confide in him.  He generously imputed the\\r\\nwhole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before\\r\\nthought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the\\r\\nworld.  His character was to speak for itself.  He called it,\\r\\ntherefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an\\r\\nevil which had been brought on by himself.  If he had\\r\\nanother motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.  He\\r\\nhad been some days in town, before he was able to discover\\r\\nthem; but he had something to direct his search, which was more\\r\\nthan we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason\\r\\nfor his resolving to follow us.  There is a lady, it seems, a\\r\\nMrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and\\r\\nwas dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation,\\r\\nthough he did not say what.  She then took a large house in\\r\\nEdward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\\r\\nlodgings.  This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted\\r\\nwith Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as\\r\\nsoon as he got to town.  But it was two or three days before he\\r\\ncould get from her what he wanted.  She would not betray her\\r\\ntrust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she\\r\\nreally did know where her friend was to be found.  Wickham\\r\\nindeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and\\r\\nhad she been able to receive them into her house, they would\\r\\nhave taken up their abode with her.  At length, however, our\\r\\nkind friend procured the wished-for direction.  They were in\\r\\n---- street.  He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing\\r\\nLydia.  His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to\\r\\npersuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and\\r\\nreturn to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to\\r\\nreceive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.\\r\\nBut he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she\\r\\nwas.  She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of\\r\\nhis; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.  She was sure they\\r\\nshould be married some time or other, and it did not much\\r\\nsignify when.  Since such were her feelings, it only remained,\\r\\nhe thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his\\r\\nvery first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had\\r\\nnever been his design.  He confessed himself obliged to leave\\r\\nthe regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were\\r\\nvery pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences\\r\\nof Lydia\\'s flight on her own folly alone.  He meant to resign\\r\\nhis commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he\\r\\ncould conjecture very little about it.  He must go somewhere,\\r\\nbut he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing\\r\\nto live on.  Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your\\r\\nsister at once.  Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very\\r\\nrich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his\\r\\nsituation must have been benefited by marriage.  But he found,\\r\\nin reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the\\r\\nhope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some\\r\\nother country.  Under such circumstances, however, he was not\\r\\nlikely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\\r\\nThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\\r\\nWickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length\\r\\nwas reduced to be reasonable.  Every thing being settled\\r\\nbetween them, Mr. Darcy\\'s next step was to make your uncle\\r\\nacquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street\\r\\nthe evening before I came home.  But Mr. Gardiner could not be\\r\\nseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father\\r\\nwas still with him, but would quit town the next morning.  He\\r\\ndid not judge your father to be a person whom he could so\\r\\nproperly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\\r\\nseeing him till after the departure of the former.  He did not\\r\\nleave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a\\r\\ngentleman had called on business.  On Saturday he came again.\\r\\nYour father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said\\r\\nbefore, they had a great deal of talk together.  They met again\\r\\non Sunday, and then I saw him too.  It was not all settled\\r\\nbefore Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\\r\\nLongbourn.  But our visitor was very obstinate.  I fancy,\\r\\nLizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\r\\nafter all.  He has been accused of many faults at different\\r\\ntimes, but this is the true one.  Nothing was to be done that\\r\\nhe did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it\\r\\nto be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle\\r\\nwould most readily have settled the whole.  They battled it\\r\\ntogether for a long time, which was more than either the\\r\\ngentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.  But at last your\\r\\nuncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be\\r\\nof use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the\\r\\nprobable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and\\r\\nI really believe your letter this morning gave him great\\r\\npleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him\\r\\nof his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\\r\\nBut, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at\\r\\nmost.  You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for\\r\\nthe young people.  His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\\r\\nbelieve, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\\r\\nthousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his\\r\\ncommission purchased.  The reason why all this was to be done\\r\\nby him alone, was such as I have given above.  It was owing to\\r\\nhim, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\\r\\nWickham\\'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently\\r\\nthat he had been received and noticed as he was.  Perhaps there\\r\\nwas some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve,\\r\\nor anybody\\'s reserve, can be answerable for the event.  But\\r\\nin spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest\\r\\nperfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if\\r\\nwe had not given him credit for another interest in the\\r\\naffair.  When all this was resolved on, he returned again to\\r\\nhis friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was\\r\\nagreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding\\r\\ntook place, and all money matters were then to receive the last\\r\\nfinish.  I believe I have now told you every thing.  It is a\\r\\nrelation which you tell me is to give you great surprise;\\r\\nI hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.\\r\\nLydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the\\r\\nhouse.  He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in\\r\\nHertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\\r\\nsatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I\\r\\nhad not perceived, by Jane\\'s letter last Wednesday, that her\\r\\nconduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and\\r\\ntherefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.\\r\\nI talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\\r\\nrepresenting to her all the wickedness of what she had done,\\r\\nand all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.  If she\\r\\nheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not\\r\\nlisten.  I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected\\r\\nmy dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience\\r\\nwith her.  Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia\\r\\ninformed you, attended the wedding.  He dined with us the next\\r\\nday, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.\\r\\nWill you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this\\r\\nopportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say\\r\\nbefore) how much I like him.  His behaviour to us has, in every\\r\\nrespect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\\r\\na little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently,\\r\\nhis wife may teach him.  I thought him very sly; -- he hardly\\r\\never mentioned your name.  But slyness seems the fashion.  Pray\\r\\nforgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\\r\\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P.  I shall never be\\r\\nquite happy till I have been all round the park.  A low\\r\\nphaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very\\r\\nthing.  But I must write no more.  The children have been\\r\\nwanting me this half hour.  Your\\'s, very sincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\nM. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter\\r\\nof spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether\\r\\npleasure or pain bore the greatest share.  The vague and\\r\\nunsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what\\r\\nMr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\\'s match,\\r\\nwhich she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness\\r\\ntoo great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\\r\\njust, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their\\r\\ngreatest extent to be true!  He had followed them purposely to\\r\\ntown, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification\\r\\nattendant on such a research; in which supplication had been\\r\\nnecessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and\\r\\nwhere he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,\\r\\npersuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished\\r\\nto avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\\r\\npronounce.  He had done all this for a girl whom he could\\r\\nneither regard nor esteem.  Her heart did whisper that he had\\r\\ndone it for her.  But it was a hope shortly checked by other\\r\\nconsiderations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was\\r\\ninsufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her\\r\\n-- for a woman who had already refused him -- as able to\\r\\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against\\r\\nrelationship with Wickham.  Brother-in-law of Wickham!  Every\\r\\nkind of pride must revolt from the connection.  He had, to be\\r\\nsure, done much.  She was ashamed to think how much.  But he\\r\\nhad given a reason for his interference, which asked no\\r\\nextraordinary stretch of belief.  It was reasonable that he\\r\\nshould feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had\\r\\nthe means of exercising it; and though she would not place\\r\\nherself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps,\\r\\nbelieve that remaining partiality for her might assist his\\r\\nendeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\\r\\nmaterially concerned.  It was painful, exceedingly painful, to\\r\\nknow that they were under obligations to a person who could\\r\\nnever receive a return.  They owed the restoration of Lydia,\\r\\nher character, every thing, to him.  Oh!  how heartily did she\\r\\ngrieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,\\r\\nevery saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.  For\\r\\nherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.  Proud that\\r\\nin a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get\\r\\nthe better of himself.  She read over her aunt\\'s commendation\\r\\nof him again and again.  It was hardly enough; but it pleased\\r\\nher.  She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with\\r\\nregret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had\\r\\nbeen persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between\\r\\nMr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some\\r\\none\\'s approach; and before she could strike into another path,\\r\\nshe was overtaken by Wickham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\"\\r\\nsaid he, as he joined her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not\\r\\nfollow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.  We were always good\\r\\nfriends; and now we are better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  Are the others coming out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the\\r\\ncarriage to Meryton.  And so, my dear sister, I find, from\\r\\nour uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would\\r\\nbe too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to\\r\\nNewcastle.  And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?  Poor\\r\\nReynolds, she was always very fond of me.  But of course she\\r\\ndid not mention my name to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\\r\\n-- not turned out well.  At such a distance as that, you\\r\\nknow, things are strangely misrepresented.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips.  Elizabeth hoped she\\r\\nhad silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.  We passed\\r\\neach other several times.  I wonder what he can be doing\\r\\nthere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"It must be something particular, to take him there\\r\\nat this time of year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly.  Did you see him while you were at Lambton?\\r\\nI thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\\r\\nthis year or two.  When I last saw her, she was not very\\r\\npromising.  I am very glad you liked her.  I hope she will turn\\r\\nout well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\\r\\nhad.  A most delightful place! -- Excellent Parsonage House!\\r\\nIt would have suited me in every respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceedingly well.  I should have considered it as part of my\\r\\nduty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.  One ought\\r\\nnot to repine; -- but, to be sure, it would have been such a\\r\\nthing for me!  The quiet, the retirement of such a life would\\r\\nhave answered all my ideas of happiness!  But it was not to be.\\r\\nDid you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were\\r\\nin Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good,\\r\\nthat it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\\r\\npresent patron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have.  Yes, there was something in that; I told you so\\r\\nfrom the first, you may remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making\\r\\nwas not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that\\r\\nyou actually declared your resolution of never taking orders,\\r\\nand that the business had been compromised accordingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did!  and it was not wholly without foundation.  You may\\r\\nremember what I told you on that point, when first we talked\\r\\nof it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she\\r\\nhad walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her\\r\\nsister\\'s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with\\r\\na good-humoured smile,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.\\r\\nDo not let us quarrel about the past.  In future, I hope we\\r\\nshall be always of one mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate\\r\\ngallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they\\r\\nentered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 53\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation\\r\\nthat he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear\\r\\nsister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was\\r\\npleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day of his and Lydia\\'s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwas forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by\\r\\nno means entered into her scheme of their all going to\\r\\nNewcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  I don\\'t know.  Not these two or three years,\\r\\nperhaps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As often as I can.  But you know married women have never much\\r\\ntime for writing.  My sisters may write to me.  They will\\r\\nhave nothing else to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s adieus were much more affectionate than his\\r\\nwife\\'s.  He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were\\r\\nout of the house, \"as ever I saw.  He simpers, and smirks, and\\r\\nmakes love to us all.  I am prodigiously proud of him.  I defy\\r\\neven Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable\\r\\nson-in-law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for\\r\\nseveral days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as\\r\\nparting with one\\'s friends.  One seems so forlorn without\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying\\r\\na daughter,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It must make you better\\r\\nsatisfied that your other four are single.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no such thing.  Lydia does not leave me because she is\\r\\nmarried, but only because her husband\\'s regiment happens to be\\r\\nso far off.  If that had been nearer, she would not have gone\\r\\nso soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into\\r\\nwas shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the\\r\\nagitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be\\r\\nin circulation.  The housekeeper at Netherfield had received\\r\\norders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming\\r\\ndown in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.  She looked at Jane, and\\r\\nsmiled and shook her head by turns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\"\\r\\n(for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news).  \"Well, so\\r\\nmuch the better.  Not that I care about it, though.  He is\\r\\nnothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to\\r\\nsee him again.  But, however, he is very welcome to come to\\r\\nNetherfield, if he likes it.  And who knows what may\\r\\nhappen?  But that is nothing to us.  You know, sister, we\\r\\nagreed long ago never to mention a word about it.  And so,\\r\\nis it quite certain he is coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls\\r\\nwas in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out\\r\\nmyself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that\\r\\nit was certain true.  He comes down on Thursday at the latest,\\r\\nvery likely on Wednesday.  She was going to the butcher\\'s, she\\r\\ntold me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she\\r\\nhas got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without\\r\\nchanging colour.  It was many months since she had mentioned\\r\\nhis name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone\\r\\ntogether, she said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of\\r\\nthe present report; and I know I appeared distressed.  But\\r\\ndon\\'t imagine it was from any silly cause.  I was only confused\\r\\nfor the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at.\\r\\nI do assure you that the news does not affect me either with\\r\\npleasure or pain.  I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone;\\r\\nbecause we shall see the less of him.  Not that I am afraid of\\r\\nmyself, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it.  Had she not seen\\r\\nhim in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of\\r\\ncoming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but\\r\\nshe still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to\\r\\nthe greater probability of his coming there with his friend\\'s\\r\\npermission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man\\r\\ncannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without\\r\\nraising all this speculation!  I will leave him to himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be\\r\\nher feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could\\r\\neasily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.  They\\r\\nwere more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their\\r\\nparents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"you will wait on him of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no.  You forced me into visiting him last year, and\\r\\npromised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my\\r\\ndaughters.  But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on\\r\\na fool\\'s errand again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an\\r\\nattention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he.  \"If he wants our\\r\\nsociety, let him seek it.  He knows where we live.  I will not\\r\\nspend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they\\r\\ngo away and come back again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do\\r\\nnot wait on him.  But, however, that shan\\'t prevent my asking\\r\\nhim to dine here, I am determined.  We must have Mrs. Long and\\r\\nthe Gouldings soon.  That will make thirteen with ourselves, so\\r\\nthere will be just room at table for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear\\r\\nher husband\\'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know\\r\\nthat her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence\\r\\nof it, before they did.  As the day of his arrival drew near,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her\\r\\nsister.  \"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\\r\\nindifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\\r\\ntalked of.  My mother means well; but she does not know, no one\\r\\ncan know, how much I suffer from what she says.  Happy shall I\\r\\nbe, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power.  You must feel\\r\\nit; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a\\r\\nsufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley arrived.  Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of\\r\\nservants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that\\r\\nthe period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as\\r\\nlong as it could.  She counted the days that must intervene\\r\\nbefore their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him\\r\\nbefore.  But on the third morning after his arrival in\\r\\nHertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\\r\\nenter the paddock and ride towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.  Jane\\r\\nresolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to\\r\\nsatisfy her mother, went to the window -- she looked, -- she\\r\\nsaw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it\\r\\nbe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I\\r\\ndo not know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to\\r\\nbe with him before.  Mr. what\\'s-his-name.  That tall, proud\\r\\nman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Mr. Darcy! -- and so it does, I vow.  Well,\\r\\nany friend of Mr. Bingley\\'s will always be welcome here, to be\\r\\nsure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.  She knew\\r\\nbut little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt\\r\\nfor the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him\\r\\nalmost for the first time after receiving his explanatory\\r\\nletter.  Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.  Each felt for\\r\\nthe other, and of course for themselves; and their mother\\r\\ntalked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to\\r\\nbe civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\\'s friend, without being\\r\\nheard by either of them.  But Elizabeth had sources of\\r\\nuneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she\\r\\nhad never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\\'s letter, or to\\r\\nrelate her own change of sentiment towards him.  To Jane, he\\r\\ncould be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose\\r\\nmerit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\r\\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were\\r\\nindebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded\\r\\nherself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as\\r\\nreasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.  Her\\r\\nastonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield, to\\r\\nLongbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal\\r\\nto what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour\\r\\nin Derbyshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for\\r\\nhalf a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight\\r\\nadded lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time\\r\\nthat his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.  But she\\r\\nwould not be secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be\\r\\nearly enough for expectation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without\\r\\ndaring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them\\r\\nto the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the\\r\\ndoor.  Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate\\r\\nthan Elizabeth had expected.  On the gentlemen\\'s appearing, her\\r\\ncolour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease,\\r\\nand with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom\\r\\nof resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and\\r\\nsat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\\r\\noften command.  She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.  He\\r\\nlooked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been\\r\\nused to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at\\r\\nPemberley.  But, perhaps he could not in her mother\\'s presence\\r\\nbe what he was before her uncle and aunt.  It was a painful,\\r\\nbut not an improbable, conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that\\r\\nshort period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.  He\\r\\nwas received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which\\r\\nmade her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with\\r\\nthe cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address\\r\\nto his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the\\r\\nlatter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\\r\\nirremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\\r\\ndegree by a distinction so ill applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a\\r\\nquestion which she could not answer without confusion, said\\r\\nscarcely any thing.  He was not seated by her; perhaps that was\\r\\nthe reason of his silence; but it had not been so in\\r\\nDerbyshire.  There he had talked to her friends, when he could\\r\\nnot to herself.  But now several minutes elapsed without\\r\\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable\\r\\nto resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his\\r\\nface, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and\\r\\nfrequently on no object but the ground.  More thoughtfulness\\r\\nand less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were\\r\\nplainly expressed.  She was disappointed, and angry with\\r\\nherself for being so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she.  \"Yet why did\\r\\nhe come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself;\\r\\nand to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.  \"I began to be afraid you would never come back\\r\\nagain.  People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;\\r\\nbut, however, I hope it is not true.  A great many changes have\\r\\nhappened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.  Miss Lucas\\r\\nis married and settled.  And one of my own daughters.\\r\\nI suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen\\r\\nit in the papers.  It was in The Times and The Courier, I\\r\\nknow; though it was not put in as it ought to be.  It was only\\r\\nsaid, ``Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\\'\\'\\r\\nwithout there being a syllable said of her father, or the place\\r\\nwhere she lived, or any thing.  It was my brother Gardiner\\'s\\r\\ndrawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an\\r\\nawkward business of it.  Did you see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\\r\\nElizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.  How Mr. Darcy looked,\\r\\ntherefore, she could not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter\\r\\nwell married,\" continued her mother, \"but at the same time,\\r\\nMr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from\\r\\nme.  They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward,\\r\\nit seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long.\\r\\nHis regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his\\r\\nleaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.\\r\\nThank Heaven!  he has some friends, though perhaps not so\\r\\nmany as he deserves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was\\r\\nin such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.\\r\\nIt drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which\\r\\nnothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked\\r\\nBingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at\\r\\npresent.  A few weeks, he believed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\"\\r\\nsaid her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as\\r\\nmany as you please on Mr. Bennet\\'s manor.  I am sure he\\r\\nwill be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the\\r\\nbest of the covies for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such\\r\\nofficious attention!  Were the same fair prospect to arise at\\r\\npresent as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was\\r\\npersuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.\\r\\nAt that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not\\r\\nmake Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful\\r\\nconfusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never\\r\\nmore to be in company with either of them.  Their society can\\r\\nafford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as\\r\\nthis!  Let me never see either one or the other again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\r\\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from\\r\\nobserving how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the\\r\\nadmiration of her former lover.  When first he came in, he had\\r\\nspoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be\\r\\ngiving her more of his attention.  He found her as handsome as\\r\\nshe had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected,\\r\\nthough not quite so chatty.  Jane was anxious that no\\r\\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really\\r\\npersuaded that she talked as much as ever.  But her mind was\\r\\nso busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of\\r\\nher intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to\\r\\ndine at Longbourn in a few days time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added,\\r\\n\"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take\\r\\na family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.  I have not\\r\\nforgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed\\r\\nthat you did not come back and keep your engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\\r\\nsomething of his concern at having been prevented by business.\\r\\nThey then went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and\\r\\ndine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good\\r\\ntable, she did not think any thing less than two courses could\\r\\nbe good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs,\\r\\nor satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 54\\r\\n\\r\\nAS soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover\\r\\nher spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption\\r\\non those subjects that must deaden them more.  Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nbehaviour astonished and vexed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\"\\r\\nsaid she, \"did he come at all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and\\r\\naunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?  If he fears me,\\r\\nwhy come hither?  If he no longer cares for me, why silent?\\r\\nTeazing, teazing, man!  I will think no more about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by\\r\\nthe approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful\\r\\nlook, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors,\\r\\nthan Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel\\r\\nperfectly easy.  I know my own strength, and I shall never be\\r\\nembarrassed again by his coming.  I am glad he dines here on\\r\\nTuesday.  It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides,\\r\\nwe meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly.\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much\\r\\nin love with you as ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the\\r\\nhappy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness\\r\\nof Bingley, in half an hour\\'s visit, had revived.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn;\\r\\nand the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of\\r\\ntheir punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.  When\\r\\nthey repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to\\r\\nsee whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their\\r\\nformer parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.  Her\\r\\nprudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite\\r\\nhim to sit by herself.  On entering the room, he seemed to\\r\\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to\\r\\nsmile: it was decided.  He placed himself by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\\r\\nfriend.  He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\\r\\nimagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy,\\r\\nhad she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nwith an expression of half-laughing alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\\r\\nshewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than\\r\\nformerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,\\r\\nJane\\'s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.\\r\\nThough she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet\\r\\nreceived pleasure from observing his behaviour.  It gave her\\r\\nall the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\r\\nno cheerful humour.  Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as\\r\\nthe table could divide them.  He was on one side of her mother.\\r\\nShe knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to\\r\\neither, or make either appear to advantage.  She was not near\\r\\nenough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how\\r\\nseldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was\\r\\ntheir manner whenever they did.  Her mother\\'s ungraciousness,\\r\\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind; and she would, at times, have given any\\r\\nthing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was\\r\\nneither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\\r\\nof bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would\\r\\nnot pass away without enabling them to enter into something\\r\\nmore of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation\\r\\nattending his entrance.  Anxious and uneasy, the period which\\r\\npassed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was\\r\\nwearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\\r\\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\\r\\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he does not come to me, then,\" said she, \"I shall give\\r\\nhim up for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would\\r\\nhave answered her hopes; but, alas!  the ladies had crowded\\r\\nround the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and\\r\\nElizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy\\r\\nthat there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit\\r\\nof a chair.  And on the gentlemen\\'s approaching, one of the\\r\\ngirls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined.  We want\\r\\nnone of them; do we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room.  She\\r\\nfollowed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke,\\r\\nhad scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and\\r\\nthen was enraged against herself for being so silly!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who has once been refused!  How could I ever be foolish\\r\\nenough to expect a renewal of his love?  Is there one among the\\r\\nsex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second\\r\\nproposal to the same woman?  There is no indignity so abhorrent\\r\\nto their feelings!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\\r\\ncoffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And quite alone?  Have all her friends left her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her.  The others have been gone on to\\r\\nScarborough, these three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to\\r\\nconverse with her, he might have better success.  He stood by\\r\\nher, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on\\r\\nthe young lady\\'s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed,\\r\\nthe ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon\\r\\njoined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him\\r\\nfall a victim to her mother\\'s rapacity for whist players, and\\r\\nin a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.  She\\r\\nnow lost every expectation of pleasure.  They were confined for\\r\\nthe evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope,\\r\\nbut that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the\\r\\nroom, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen\\r\\nto supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any\\r\\nof the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to\\r\\nthemselves, \"What say you to the day?  I think every thing has\\r\\npassed off uncommonly well, I assure you.  The dinner was as\\r\\nwell dressed as any I ever saw.  The venison was roasted to a\\r\\nturn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.  The\\r\\nsoup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases\\'\\r\\nlast week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\\r\\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three\\r\\nFrench cooks at least.  And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look\\r\\nin greater beauty.  Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her\\r\\nwhether you did not.  And what do you think she said besides?\\r\\n``Ah!  Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\\'\\'\\r\\nShe did indeed.  I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as\\r\\never lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and\\r\\nnot at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen\\r\\nenough of Bingley\\'s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she\\r\\nwould get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her\\r\\nfamily, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that\\r\\nshe was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the\\r\\nnext day, to make his proposals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable\\r\\none with the other.  I hope we may often meet again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so.  You must not suspect me.  It\\r\\nmortifies me.  I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy\\r\\nhis conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man,\\r\\nwithout having a wish beyond it.  I am perfectly satisfied,\\r\\nfrom what his manners now are, that he never had any design\\r\\nof engaging my affection.  It is only that he is blessed\\r\\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of\\r\\ngenerally pleasing, than any other man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me\\r\\nsmile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\r\\nacknowledge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.  We all\\r\\nlove to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth\\r\\nknowing.  Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do\\r\\nnot make me your confidante.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 55\\r\\n\\r\\nA FEW days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and\\r\\nalone.  His friend had left him that morning for London, but\\r\\nwas to return home in ten days time.  He sat with them above an\\r\\nhour, and was in remarkably good spirits.  Mrs. Bennet invited\\r\\nhim to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern,\\r\\nhe confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more\\r\\nlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if\\r\\nshe would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of\\r\\nwaiting on them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her\\r\\ninvitation was accepted with alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none\\r\\nof them dressed.  In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\\'s room, in\\r\\nher dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.  He is come --\\r\\nMr. Bingley is come. -- He is, indeed.  Make haste, make haste.\\r\\nHere, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on\\r\\nwith her gown.  Never mind Miss Lizzy\\'s hair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say\\r\\nKitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs\\r\\nhalf an hour ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  hang Kitty!  what has she to do with it?  Come be quick,\\r\\nbe quick!  Where is your sash, my dear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to\\r\\ngo down without one of her sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again\\r\\nin the evening.  After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library,\\r\\nas was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.\\r\\nTwo obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a\\r\\nconsiderable time, without making any impression on them.\\r\\nElizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did,\\r\\nshe very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma?  What do\\r\\nyou keep winking at me for?  What am I to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing child, nothing.  I did not wink at you.\"  She then sat\\r\\nstill five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious\\r\\noccasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here,\\r\\nmy love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room.\\r\\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her\\r\\ndistress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she\\r\\nwould not give in to it.  In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nhalf-opened the door and called out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her\\r\\nmother, as soon as she was in the hall.  \"Kitty and I are going\\r\\nup stairs to sit in my dressing room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but\\r\\nremained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of\\r\\nsight, then returned into the drawing room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s schemes for this day were ineffectual.  Bingley\\r\\nwas every thing that was charming, except the professed lover\\r\\nof her daughter.  His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a\\r\\nmost agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore\\r\\nwith the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all\\r\\nher silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance\\r\\nparticularly grateful to the daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he\\r\\nwent away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own\\r\\nand Mrs. Bennet\\'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot\\r\\nwith her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.\\r\\nNot a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but\\r\\nElizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must\\r\\nspeedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the\\r\\nstated time.  Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded\\r\\nthat all this must have taken place with that gentleman\\'s\\r\\nconcurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet\\r\\nspent the morning together, as had been agreed on.  The latter\\r\\nwas much more agreeable than his companion expected.  There was\\r\\nnothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke\\r\\nhis ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more\\r\\ncommunicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen\\r\\nhim.  Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the\\r\\nevening Mrs. Bennet\\'s invention was again at work to get every\\r\\nbody away from him and her daughter.  Elizabeth, who had a\\r\\nletter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose\\r\\nsoon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to\\r\\ncards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother\\'s\\r\\nschemes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was\\r\\nfinished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was\\r\\nreason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for\\r\\nher.  On opening the door, she perceived her sister and\\r\\nBingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\\r\\nearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the\\r\\nfaces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away\\r\\nfrom each other, would have told it all.  Their situation\\r\\nwas awkward enough; but her\\'s she thought was still worse.\\r\\nNot a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on\\r\\nthe point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as\\r\\nthe other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\\r\\nwords to her sister, ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence\\r\\nwould give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,\\r\\nwith the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature\\r\\nin the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much.  I do not\\r\\ndeserve it.  Oh!  why is not every body as happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\\r\\nwarmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.  Every\\r\\nsentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.\\r\\nBut she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say\\r\\nhalf that remained to be said for the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried.  \"I would not on\\r\\nany account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow\\r\\nher to hear it from any one but myself.  He is gone to my\\r\\nfather already.  Oh!  Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate\\r\\nwill give such pleasure to all my dear family!  how shall I\\r\\nbear so much happiness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken\\r\\nup the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity\\r\\nand ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had\\r\\ngiven them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious\\r\\ncircumspection!  of all his sister\\'s falsehood and contrivance!\\r\\nthe happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference\\r\\nwith her father had been short and to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With my mother up stairs.  She will be down in a moment,\\r\\nI dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good\\r\\nwishes and affection of a sister.  Elizabeth honestly and\\r\\nheartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their\\r\\nrelationship.  They shook hands with great cordiality; and\\r\\nthen, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he\\r\\nhad to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\\'s perfections;\\r\\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed\\r\\nall his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded,\\r\\nbecause they had for basis the excellent understanding, and\\r\\nsuper-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity\\r\\nof feeling and taste between her and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the\\r\\nsatisfaction of Miss Bennet\\'s mind gave a glow of such sweet\\r\\nanimation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\\r\\nKitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation\\r\\nin terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked\\r\\nto Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr.\\r\\nBennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly\\r\\nshewed how really happy he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till\\r\\ntheir visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone, he turned to his daughter, and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jane, I congratulate you.  You will be a very happy woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\r\\ngoodness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure\\r\\nin thinking you will be so happily settled.  I have not a doubt\\r\\nof your doing very well together.  Your tempers are by no means\\r\\nunlike.  You are each of you so complying, that nothing will\\r\\never be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat\\r\\nyou; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not so.  Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters\\r\\nwould be unpardonable in me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceed their income!  My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife,\\r\\n\"what are you talking of?  Why, he has four or five thousand a\\r\\nyear, and very likely more.\"  Then addressing her daughter,\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!  I am sure I shan\\'t\\r\\nget a wink of sleep all night.  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nalways said it must be so, at last.  I was sure you could not\\r\\nbe so beautiful for nothing!  I remember, as soon as ever I saw\\r\\nhim, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought\\r\\nhow likely it was that you should come together.  Oh!  he is\\r\\nthe handsomest young man that ever was seen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.  Jane was beyond\\r\\ncompetition her favourite child.  At that moment, she cared\\r\\nfor no other.  Her younger sisters soon began to make interest\\r\\nwith her for objects of happiness which she might in future be\\r\\nable to dispense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and\\r\\nKitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\\r\\nLongbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\\r\\nremaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\\r\\nneighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him\\r\\nan invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to\\r\\naccept.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\\r\\nsister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to\\r\\nbestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably\\r\\nuseful to both of them in those hours of separation that must\\r\\nsometimes occur.  In the absence of Jane, he always attached\\r\\nhimself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and\\r\\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means\\r\\nof relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling\\r\\nme that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last\\r\\nspring!  I had not believed it possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But how did he\\r\\naccount for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing.  They were certainly no\\r\\nfriends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,\\r\\nsince he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many\\r\\nrespects.  But when they see, as I trust they will, that their\\r\\nbrother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and\\r\\nwe shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we\\r\\nonce were to each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that\\r\\nI ever heard you utter.  Good girl!  It would vex me, indeed,\\r\\nto see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last\\r\\nNovember, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of\\r\\nmy being indifferent would have prevented his coming down\\r\\nagain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit\\r\\nof his modesty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\\r\\ndiffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\\r\\nqualities.  Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not\\r\\nbetrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had\\r\\nthe most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew\\r\\nit was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\"\\r\\ncried Jane.  \"Oh!  Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family,\\r\\nand blessed above them all!  If I could but see you as happy!\\r\\nIf there were but such another man for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so\\r\\nhappy as you.  Till I have your disposition, your goodness,\\r\\nI never can have your happiness.  No, no, let me shift for\\r\\nmyself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet\\r\\nwith another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be\\r\\nlong a secret.  Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to\\r\\nMrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do\\r\\nthe same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family\\r\\nin the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had\\r\\nfirst run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out\\r\\nfor misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 56\\r\\n\\r\\nONE morning, about a week after Bingley\\'s engagement with\\r\\nJane had been formed, as he and the females of the family\\r\\nwere sitting together in the dining room, their attention\\r\\nwas suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage;\\r\\nand they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.\\r\\nIt was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\\r\\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\\r\\nThe horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery\\r\\nof the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.  As it\\r\\nwas certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley\\r\\ninstantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of\\r\\nsuch an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.\\r\\nThey both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\\r\\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was\\r\\nthrown open and their visitor entered.  It was Lady Catherine\\r\\nde Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\r\\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to\\r\\nthem, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\\r\\nmade no other reply to Elizabeth\\'s salutation than a slight\\r\\ninclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\\r\\nElizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her\\r\\nladyship\\'s entrance, though no request of introduction had been\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a\\r\\nguest of such high importance, received her with the utmost\\r\\npoliteness.  After sitting for a moment in silence, she said\\r\\nvery stiffly to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.  That lady, I suppose,\\r\\nis your mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  \"She is my youngest girl but one.  My youngest of\\r\\nall is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the\\r\\ngrounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon\\r\\nbecome a part of the family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine\\r\\nafter a short silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say;\\r\\nbut I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,\\r\\nin summer; the windows are full west.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,\\r\\nand then added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you\\r\\nleft Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very well.  I saw them the night before last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for\\r\\nher from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for\\r\\nher calling.  But no letter appeared, and she was completely\\r\\npuzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take\\r\\nsome refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not\\r\\nvery politely, declined eating any thing; and then, rising up,\\r\\nsaid to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\\r\\nwilderness on one side of your lawn.  I should be glad to take\\r\\na turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about\\r\\nthe different walks.  I think she will be pleased with the\\r\\nhermitage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her\\r\\nparasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.  As they passed\\r\\nthrough the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the\\r\\ndining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a\\r\\nshort survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\r\\nwaiting-woman was in it.  They proceeded in silence along the\\r\\ngravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to\\r\\nmake no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more\\r\\nthan usually insolent and disagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she\\r\\nlooked in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\\r\\nfollowing manner: --\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason\\r\\nof my journey hither.  Your own heart, your own conscience,\\r\\nmust tell you why I come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.  I have not been at all able\\r\\nto account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you\\r\\nought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.  But however\\r\\ninsincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.\\r\\nMy character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and\\r\\nfrankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not depart from it.  A report of a most alarming\\r\\nnature reached me two days ago.  I was told that not only your\\r\\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married,\\r\\nbut that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all\\r\\nlikelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own\\r\\nnephew, Mr. Darcy.  Though I know it must be a scandalous\\r\\nfalsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose\\r\\nthe truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off\\r\\nfor this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\ncolouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the\\r\\ntrouble of coming so far.  What could your ladyship propose by\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally\\r\\ncontradicted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\\r\\nindeed, such a report is in existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If!  Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?  Has it not\\r\\nbeen industriously circulated by yourselves?  Do you not know\\r\\nthat such a report is spread abroad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation\\r\\nfor it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your\\r\\nladyship.  You may ask questions which I shall not\\r\\nchoose to answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is not to be borne.  Miss Bennet, I insist on being\\r\\nsatisfied.  Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\\r\\nhis reason.  But your arts and allurements may, in a moment\\r\\nof infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself\\r\\nand to all his family.  You may have drawn him in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?  I have not been accustomed\\r\\nto such language as this.  I am almost the nearest relation he\\r\\nhas in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest\\r\\nconcerns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such\\r\\nbehaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me be rightly understood.  This match, to which you have\\r\\nthe presumption to aspire, can never take place.  No, never.\\r\\nMr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.  Now what have you to\\r\\nsay?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose\\r\\nhe will make an offer to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.  From their\\r\\ninfancy, they have been intended for each other.  It was the\\r\\nfavourite wish of his mother, as well as of her\\'s.  While in\\r\\ntheir cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment\\r\\nwhen the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their\\r\\nmarriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth,\\r\\nof no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the\\r\\nfamily!  Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\\r\\nTo his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?  Are you lost to\\r\\nevery feeling of propriety and delicacy?  Have you not heard\\r\\nme say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his\\r\\ncousin?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before.  But what is that to me?  If\\r\\nthere is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and\\r\\naunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.  You both did as much\\r\\nas you could in planning the marriage.  Its completion depended\\r\\non others.  If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination\\r\\nconfined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?\\r\\nAnd if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\\r\\nYes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed\\r\\nby his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\\r\\ninclinations of all.  You will be censured, slighted, and\\r\\ndespised, by every one connected with him.  Your alliance will\\r\\nbe a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any\\r\\nof us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But the\\r\\nwife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of\\r\\nhappiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she\\r\\ncould, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl!  I am ashamed of you!  Is this\\r\\nyour gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?  Is\\r\\nnothing due to me on that score?  Let us sit down.  You are to\\r\\nunderstand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined\\r\\nresolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded\\r\\nfrom it.  I have not been used to submit to any person\\'s whims.\\r\\nI have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more\\r\\npitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not be interrupted.  Hear me in silence.  My daughter\\r\\nand my nephew are formed for each other.  They are descended,\\r\\non the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the\\r\\nfather\\'s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient -- though\\r\\nuntitled -- families.  Their fortune on both sides is splendid.\\r\\nThey are destined for each other by the voice of every member\\r\\nof their respective houses; and what is to divide them?  The\\r\\nupstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\\r\\nconnections, or fortune.  Is this to be endured!  But it\\r\\nmust not, shall not be.  If you were sensible of your own\\r\\ngood, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you\\r\\nhave been brought up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\\r\\nquitting that sphere.  He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\'s\\r\\ndaughter; so far we are equal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  You are a gentleman\\'s daughter.  But who was your\\r\\nmother?  Who are your uncles and aunts?  Do not imagine me\\r\\nignorant of their condition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your\\r\\nnephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging\\r\\nLady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but\\r\\nsay, after a moment\\'s deliberation,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an\\r\\nengagement?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.  I expected to find a\\r\\nmore reasonable young woman.  But do not deceive yourself into\\r\\na belief that I will ever recede.  I shall not go away till you\\r\\nhave given me the assurance I require.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I certainly never shall give it.  I am not to be\\r\\nintimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.  Your\\r\\nladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would\\r\\nmy giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at\\r\\nall more probable?  Supposing him to be attached to me,\\r\\nwould my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow\\r\\nit on his cousin?  Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the\\r\\narguments with which you have supported this extraordinary\\r\\napplication have been as frivolous as the application was\\r\\nill-judged.  You have widely mistaken my character, if you\\r\\nthink I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\\r\\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in\\r\\nhis affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no\\r\\nright to concern yourself in mine.  I must beg, therefore,\\r\\nto be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please.  I have by no means done.\\r\\nTo all the objections I have already urged, I have still\\r\\nanother to add.  I am no stranger to the particulars of your\\r\\nyoungest sister\\'s infamous elopement.  I know it all; that\\r\\nthe young man\\'s marrying her was a patched-up business, at\\r\\nthe expence of your father and uncles.  And is such a girl\\r\\nto be my nephew\\'s sister?  Is her husband, is the son of\\r\\nhis late father\\'s steward, to be his brother?  Heaven and\\r\\nearth! -- of what are you thinking?  Are the shades of\\r\\nPemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can now have nothing farther to say,\" she resentfully\\r\\nanswered.  \"You have insulted me in every possible method.\\r\\nI must beg to return to the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she rose as she spoke.  Lady Catherine rose also, and they\\r\\nturned back.  Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my\\r\\nnephew!  Unfeeling, selfish girl!  Do you not consider that\\r\\na connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of\\r\\neverybody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.  You know my\\r\\nsentiments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have said no such thing.  I am only resolved to act in that\\r\\nmanner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,\\r\\nwithout reference to you, or to any person so wholly\\r\\nunconnected with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is well.  You refuse, then, to oblige me.  You refuse to\\r\\nobey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.  You are\\r\\ndetermined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and\\r\\nmake him the contempt of the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\n\"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.  No\\r\\nprinciple of either would be violated by my marriage with\\r\\nMr. Darcy.  And with regard to the resentment of his family, or\\r\\nthe indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his\\r\\nmarrying me, it would not give me one moment\\'s concern -- and\\r\\nthe world in general would have too much sense to join in the\\r\\nscorn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is your real opinion!  This is your final resolve!\\r\\nVery well.  I shall now know how to act.  Do not imagine, Miss\\r\\nBennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.  I came to\\r\\ntry you.  I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it,\\r\\nI will carry my point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the\\r\\ndoor of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,\\r\\n\"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.  I send no compliments to\\r\\nyour mother.  You deserve no such attention.  I am most\\r\\nseriously displeased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade\\r\\nher ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it\\r\\nherself.  She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up\\r\\nstairs.  Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the\\r\\ndressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in\\r\\nagain and rest herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman!  and her calling here was\\r\\nprodigiously civil!  for she only came, I suppose, to tell us\\r\\nthe Collinses were well.  She is on her road somewhere, I dare\\r\\nsay, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well\\r\\ncall on you.  I suppose she had nothing particular to say to\\r\\nyou, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here;\\r\\nfor to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was\\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 57\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit\\r\\nthrew Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could\\r\\nshe, for many hours, learn to think of it less than\\r\\nincessantly.  Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken\\r\\nthe trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose\\r\\nof breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.  It was\\r\\na rational scheme, to be sure!  but from what the report of\\r\\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to\\r\\nimagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate\\r\\nfriend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was\\r\\nenough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made\\r\\nevery body eager for another, to supply the idea.  She had not\\r\\nherself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must\\r\\nbring them more frequently together.  And her neighbours at\\r\\nLucas lodge, therefore (for through their communication with\\r\\nthe Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady\\r\\nCatherine), had only set that down as almost certain and\\r\\nimmediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at\\r\\nsome future time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine\\'s expressions, however, she could\\r\\nnot help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence\\r\\nof her persisting in this interference.  From what she had said\\r\\nof her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to\\r\\nElizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;\\r\\nand how he might take a similar representation of the evils\\r\\nattached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.\\r\\nShe knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or\\r\\nhis dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\r\\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could\\r\\ndo; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a\\r\\nmarriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal\\r\\nto his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.\\r\\nWith his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the\\r\\narguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous,\\r\\ncontained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which\\r\\nhad often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a\\r\\nrelation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to\\r\\nbe as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.  In that\\r\\ncase he would return no more.  Lady Catherine might see him in\\r\\nher way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming\\r\\nagain to Netherfield must give way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should\\r\\ncome to his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall\\r\\nknow how to understand it.  I shall then give over every\\r\\nexpectation, every wish of his constancy.  If he is satisfied\\r\\nwith only regretting me, when he might have obtained my\\r\\naffections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their\\r\\nvisitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\\r\\nit, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much\\r\\nteazing on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by\\r\\nher father, who came out of his library with a letter in his\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my\\r\\nroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he\\r\\nhad to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being\\r\\nin some manner connected with the letter he held.  It suddenly\\r\\nstruck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she\\r\\nanticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\\r\\ndown.  He then said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\r\\nexceedingly.  As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to\\r\\nknow its contents.  I did not know before, that I had two\\r\\ndaughters on the brink of matrimony.  Let me congratulate you\\r\\non a very important conquest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\'s cheeks in the\\r\\ninstantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\\r\\ninstead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to\\r\\nbe pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that\\r\\nhis letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\\r\\ncontinued,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You look conscious.  Young ladies have great penetration in\\r\\nsuch matters as these; but I think I may defy even your\\r\\nsagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.  This letter\\r\\nis from Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From Mr. Collins!  and what can he have to say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course.  He begins\\r\\nwith congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest\\r\\ndaughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\\r\\ngood-natured, gossiping Lucases.  I shall not sport with your\\r\\nimpatience, by reading what he says on that point.  What\\r\\nrelates to yourself, is as follows.\"  \"Having thus offered\\r\\nyou the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\r\\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject\\r\\nof another; of which we have been advertised by the same\\r\\nauthority.  Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not\\r\\nlong bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has\\r\\nresigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be\\r\\nreasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious\\r\\npersonages in this land.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\"  \"This\\r\\nyoung gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing\\r\\nthe heart of mortal can most desire, -- splendid property,\\r\\nnoble kindred, and extensive patronage.  Yet in spite of all\\r\\nthese temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and\\r\\nyourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure\\r\\nwith this gentleman\\'s proposals, which, of course, you will be\\r\\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?  But now it\\r\\ncomes out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My motive for cautioning you is as follows.  We have reason to\\r\\nimagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look\\r\\non the match with a friendly eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man!  Now, Lizzy, I think I\\r\\nhave surprised you.  Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched\\r\\non any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name\\r\\nwould have given the lie more effectually to what they related?\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish,\\r\\nand who probably never looked at you in his life!  It is\\r\\nadmirable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father\\'s pleasantry, but could\\r\\nonly force one most reluctant smile.  Never had his wit been\\r\\ndirected in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  yes.  Pray read on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\\r\\nladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\\r\\ncondescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it\\r\\nbecome apparent, that on the score of some family objections on\\r\\nthe part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what\\r\\nshe termed so disgraceful a match.  I thought it my duty to\\r\\ngive the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\\r\\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and\\r\\nnot run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly\\r\\nsanctioned.\"  \"Mr. Collins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced\\r\\nthat my cousin Lydia\\'s sad business has been so well hushed up,\\r\\nand am only concerned that their living together before the\\r\\nmarriage took place should be so generally known.  I must not,\\r\\nhowever, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from\\r\\ndeclaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\\r\\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married.  It was an\\r\\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn,\\r\\nI should very strenuously have opposed it.  You ought certainly\\r\\nto forgive them as a Christian, but never to admit them in your\\r\\nsight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.\"\\r\\n\"That is his notion of Christian forgiveness!  The rest of\\r\\nhis letter is only about his dear Charlotte\\'s situation, and\\r\\nhis expectation of a young olive-branch.  But, Lizzy, you look\\r\\nas if you did not enjoy it.  You are not going to be Missish,\\r\\nI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.  For\\r\\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and\\r\\nlaugh at them in our turn?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted.  But it is\\r\\nso strange!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes -- that is what makes it amusing.  Had they fixed on\\r\\nany other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect\\r\\nindifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so\\r\\ndelightfully absurd!  Much as I abominate writing, I would not\\r\\ngive up Mr. Collins\\'s correspondence for any consideration.\\r\\nNay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the\\r\\npreference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\r\\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law.  And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady\\r\\nCatherine about this report?  Did she call to refuse her\\r\\nconsent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and\\r\\nas it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not\\r\\ndistressed by his repeating it.  Elizabeth had never been\\r\\nmore at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\\r\\nIt was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\\r\\nHer father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder\\r\\nat such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\\r\\nhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 58\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTEAD of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,\\r\\nas Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to\\r\\nbring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed\\r\\nafter Lady Catherine\\'s visit.  The gentlemen arrived early;\\r\\nand, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having\\r\\nseen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread,\\r\\nBingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all\\r\\nwalking out.  It was agreed to.  Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\r\\nhabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the\\r\\nremaining five set off together.  Bingley and Jane, however,\\r\\nsoon allowed the others to outstrip them.  They lagged behind,\\r\\nwhile Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.\\r\\nVery little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of\\r\\nhim to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate\\r\\nresolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call\\r\\nupon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a\\r\\ngeneral concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with\\r\\nhim alone.  Now was the moment for her resolution to be\\r\\nexecuted, and, while her courage was high, she immediately\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of\\r\\ngiving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be\\r\\nwounding your\\'s.  I can no longer help thanking you for your\\r\\nunexampled kindness to my poor sister.  Ever since I have known\\r\\nit, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how\\r\\ngratefully I feel it.  Were it known to the rest of my family,\\r\\nI should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of\\r\\nsurprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what\\r\\nmay, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.  I did not\\r\\nthink Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not blame my aunt.  Lydia\\'s thoughtlessness first\\r\\nbetrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and,\\r\\nof course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.  Let\\r\\nme thank you again and again, in the name of all my family,\\r\\nfor that generous compassion which induced you to take so much\\r\\ntrouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of\\r\\ndiscovering them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself\\r\\nalone.  That the wish of giving happiness to you might add\\r\\nforce to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not\\r\\nattempt to deny.  But your family owe me nothing.  Much as\\r\\nI respect them, I believe I thought only of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.  After a\\r\\nshort pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to\\r\\ntrifle with me.  If your feelings are still what they were\\r\\nlast April, tell me so at once.  My affections and wishes\\r\\nare unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this\\r\\nsubject for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and\\r\\nanxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and\\r\\nimmediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand\\r\\nthat her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since\\r\\nthe period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with\\r\\ngratitude and pleasure his present assurances.  The happiness\\r\\nwhich this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\\r\\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as\\r\\nsensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be\\r\\nsupposed to do.  Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his\\r\\neye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt\\r\\ndelight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she\\r\\ncould not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings,\\r\\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\\r\\naffection every moment more valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction.  There was\\r\\ntoo much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to\\r\\nany other objects.  She soon learnt that they were indebted\\r\\nfor their present good understanding to the efforts of his\\r\\naunt, who did call on him in her return through London,\\r\\nand there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and\\r\\nthe substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling\\r\\nemphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her\\r\\nladyship\\'s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness\\r\\nand assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist\\r\\nher endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which\\r\\nshe had refused to give.  But, unluckily for her ladyship,\\r\\nits effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever\\r\\nallowed myself to hope before.  I knew enough of your\\r\\ndisposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely,\\r\\nirrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged\\r\\nit to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know\\r\\nenough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.\\r\\nAfter abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no\\r\\nscruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?  For, though\\r\\nyour accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises,\\r\\nmy behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest\\r\\nreproof.  It was unpardonable.  I cannot think of it without\\r\\nabhorrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to\\r\\nthat evening,\" said Elizabeth.  \"The conduct of neither, if\\r\\nstrictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we\\r\\nhave both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.  The recollection\\r\\nof what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions\\r\\nduring the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,\\r\\ninexpressibly painful to me.  Your reproof, so well applied, I\\r\\nshall never forget: ``had you behaved in a more gentleman-like\\r\\nmanner.\\'\\' Those were your words.  You know not, you can\\r\\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; -- though it was\\r\\nsome time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow\\r\\ntheir justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong\\r\\nan impression.  I had not the smallest idea of their being ever\\r\\nfelt in such a way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can easily believe it.  You thought me then devoid of\\r\\nevery proper feeling, I am sure you did.  The turn of your\\r\\ncountenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could\\r\\nnot have addressed you in any possible way that would induce\\r\\nyou to accept me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  do not repeat what I then said.  These recollections\\r\\nwill not do at all.  I assure you that I have long been most\\r\\nheartily ashamed of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy mentioned his letter.  \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon\\r\\nmake you think better of me?  Did you, on reading it, give any\\r\\ncredit to its contents?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how\\r\\ngradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain,\\r\\nbut it was necessary.  I hope you have destroyed the letter.\\r\\nThere was one part especially, the opening of it, which I\\r\\nshould dread your having the power of reading again.  I can\\r\\nremember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it\\r\\nessential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have\\r\\nboth reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they\\r\\nare not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself\\r\\nperfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was\\r\\nwritten in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end\\r\\nso.  The adieu is charity itself.  But think no more of the\\r\\nletter.  The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person\\r\\nwho received it, are now so widely different from what they\\r\\nwere then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it\\r\\nought to be forgotten.  You must learn some of my philosophy.\\r\\nThink only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.\\r\\nYour retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that\\r\\nthe contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but,\\r\\nwhat is much better, of innocence.  But with me, it is not\\r\\nso.  Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which\\r\\nought not, to be repelled.  I have been a selfish being all my\\r\\nlife, in practice, though not in principle.  As a child I was\\r\\ntaught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my\\r\\ntemper.  I was given good principles, but left to follow them\\r\\nin pride and conceit.  Unfortunately an only son (for many\\r\\nyears an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though\\r\\ngood themselves (my father, particularly, all that was\\r\\nbenevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me\\r\\nto be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own\\r\\nfamily circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to\\r\\nwish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth\\r\\ncompared with my own.  Such I was, from eight to eight and\\r\\ntwenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest,\\r\\nloveliest Elizabeth!  What do I not owe you!  You taught me a\\r\\nlesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.  By you,\\r\\nI was properly humbled.  I came to you without a doubt of my\\r\\nreception.  You shewed me how insufficient were all my\\r\\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I had.  What will you think of my vanity?  I believed\\r\\nyou to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally,\\r\\nI assure you.  I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits\\r\\nmight often lead me wrong.  How you must have hated me after\\r\\nthat evening?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hate you!  I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon\\r\\nbegan to take a proper direction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we\\r\\nmet at Pemberley.  You blamed me for coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being\\r\\nnoticed by you.  My conscience told me that I deserved no\\r\\nextraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect\\r\\nto receive more than my due.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to shew you, by every\\r\\ncivility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the\\r\\npast; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your\\r\\nill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been\\r\\nattended to.  How soon any other wishes introduced themselves\\r\\nI can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after\\r\\nI had seen you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then told her of Georgiana\\'s delight in her acquaintance,\\r\\nand of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which\\r\\nnaturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon\\r\\nlearnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in\\r\\nquest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn,\\r\\nand that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from\\r\\nno other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\\r\\nsubject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy\\r\\nto know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining\\r\\ntheir watches, that it was time to be at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder\\r\\nwhich introduced the discussion of their affairs.  Darcy\\r\\nwas delighted with their engagement; his friend had given\\r\\nhim the earliest information of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.  When I went away, I felt that it would soon\\r\\nhappen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission.  I guessed as\\r\\nmuch.\"  And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it\\r\\nhad been pretty much the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I made a\\r\\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long\\r\\nago.  I told him of all that had occurred to make my former\\r\\ninterference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.  His\\r\\nsurprise was great.  He had never had the slightest suspicion.\\r\\nI told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in\\r\\nsupposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to\\r\\nhim; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her\\r\\nwas unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of\\r\\ndirecting his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when\\r\\nyou told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my\\r\\ninformation last spring?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the former.  I had narrowly observed her during the two\\r\\nvisits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her\\r\\naffection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\\r\\nconviction to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It did.  Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.  His diffidence\\r\\nhad prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a\\r\\ncase, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy.  I was\\r\\nobliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not\\r\\nunjustly, offended him.  I could not allow myself to conceal\\r\\nthat your sister had been in town three months last winter,\\r\\nthat I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.  He was\\r\\nangry.  But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than\\r\\nhe remained in any doubt of your sister\\'s sentiments.  He has\\r\\nheartily forgiven me now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most\\r\\ndelightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\\r\\ninvaluable; but she checked herself.  She remembered that he\\r\\nhad yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early\\r\\nto begin.  In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of\\r\\ncourse was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\\r\\nconversation till they reached the house.  In the hall they\\r\\nparted.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 59\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a\\r\\nquestion which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she\\r\\nentered their room, and from all the others when they sat down\\r\\nto table.  She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered\\r\\nabout, till she was beyond her own knowledge.  She coloured as\\r\\nshe spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a\\r\\nsuspicion of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing\\r\\nextraordinary.  The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the\\r\\nunacknowledged were silent.  Darcy was not of a disposition in\\r\\nwhich happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and\\r\\nconfused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself\\r\\nto be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were\\r\\nother evils before her.  She anticipated what would be felt in\\r\\nthe family when her situation became known; she was aware that\\r\\nno one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others\\r\\nit was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence\\r\\nmight do away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane.  Though suspicion was\\r\\nvery far from Miss Bennet\\'s general habits, she was absolutely\\r\\nincredulous here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy.  This cannot be! -- engaged to\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  No, no, you shall not deceive me.  I know it\\r\\nto be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed!  My sole dependence was\\r\\non you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do\\r\\nnot.  Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.  I speak nothing but the\\r\\ntruth.  He still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at her doubtingly.  \"Oh, Lizzy!  it cannot be.\\r\\nI know how much you dislike him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know nothing of the matter.  That is all to be forgot.\\r\\nPerhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.  But in\\r\\nsuch cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.  This is\\r\\nthe last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement.  Elizabeth again, and\\r\\nmore seriously assured her of its truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven!  can it be really so!  Yet now I must believe\\r\\nyou,\" cried Jane.  \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would -- I do\\r\\ncongratulate you -- but are you certain?  forgive the question\\r\\n-- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There can be no doubt of that.  It is settled between us\\r\\nalready, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.\\r\\nBut are you pleased, Jane?  Shall you like to have such a\\r\\nbrother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very, very much.  Nothing could give either Bingley or\\r\\nmyself more delight.  But we considered it, we talked of it as\\r\\nimpossible.  And do you really love him quite well enough?\\r\\nOh, Lizzy!  do any thing rather than marry without affection.\\r\\nAre you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  You will only think I feel more than I ought to\\r\\ndo, when I tell you all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.\\r\\nI am afraid you will be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest sister, now be serious.  I want to talk very\\r\\nseriously.  Let me know every thing that I am to know, without\\r\\ndelay.  Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it\\r\\nbegan.  But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his\\r\\nbeautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced\\r\\nthe desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn\\r\\nassurances of attachment.  When convinced on that article, Miss\\r\\nBennet had nothing farther to wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as\\r\\nmyself.  I always had a value for him.  Were it for nothing but\\r\\nhis love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as\\r\\nBingley\\'s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley\\r\\nand yourself more dear to me.  But Lizzy, you have been very\\r\\nsly, very reserved with me.  How little did you tell me of what\\r\\npassed at Pemberley and Lambton!  I owe all that I know of it\\r\\nto another, not to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.  She had been\\r\\nunwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her\\r\\nown feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.\\r\\nBut now she would no longer conceal from her his share in\\r\\nLydia\\'s marriage.  All was acknowledged, and half the night\\r\\nspent in conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window\\r\\nthe next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming\\r\\nhere again with our dear Bingley!  What can he mean by being so\\r\\ntiresome as to be always coming here?  I had no notion but he\\r\\nwould go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us\\r\\nwith his company.  What shall we do with him?  Lizzy, you must\\r\\nwalk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\'s way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a\\r\\nproposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be\\r\\nalways giving him such an epithet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,\\r\\nand shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good\\r\\ninformation; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\nhave you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her\\r\\nway again to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.  It is a nice long walk,\\r\\nand Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but\\r\\nI am sure it will be too much for Kitty.  Won\\'t it, Kitty?\"\\r\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home.  Darcy professed\\r\\na great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth\\r\\nsilently consented.  As she went up stairs to get ready,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet followed her, saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have\\r\\nthat disagreeable man all to yourself.  But I hope you will not\\r\\nmind it: it is all for Jane\\'s sake, you know; and there is no\\r\\noccasion for talking to him, except just now and then.  So, do\\r\\nnot put yourself to inconvenience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\\'s consent\\r\\nshould be asked in the course of the evening.  Elizabeth\\r\\nreserved to herself the application for her mother\\'s.  She\\r\\ncould not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes\\r\\ndoubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough\\r\\nto overcome her abhorrence of the man.  But whether she were\\r\\nviolently set against the match, or violently delighted with\\r\\nit, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted\\r\\nto do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that\\r\\nMr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the\\r\\nfirst vehemence of her disapprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,\\r\\nshe saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation\\r\\non seeing it was extreme.  She did not fear her father\\'s\\r\\nopposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it\\r\\nshould be through her means -- that she, his favourite child,\\r\\nshould be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him\\r\\nwith fears and regrets in disposing of her -- was a wretched\\r\\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared\\r\\nagain, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his\\r\\nsmile.  In a few minutes he approached the table where she was\\r\\nsitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work\\r\\nsaid in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in the\\r\\nlibrary.\"  She was gone directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and\\r\\nanxious.  \"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing?  Are you out\\r\\nof your senses, to be accepting this man?  Have not you always\\r\\nhated him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had\\r\\nbeen more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!  It would\\r\\nhave spared her from explanations and professions which it was\\r\\nexceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and\\r\\nshe assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to\\r\\nMr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.  He is\\r\\nrich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine\\r\\ncarriages than Jane.  But will they make you happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your\\r\\nbelief of my indifference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None at all.  We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort\\r\\nof man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes,\\r\\n\"I love him.  Indeed he has no improper pride.  He is perfectly\\r\\namiable.  You do not know what he really is; then pray do not\\r\\npain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent.\\r\\nHe is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare\\r\\nrefuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.  I now give it\\r\\nto you, if you are resolved on having him.  But let me advise\\r\\nyou to think better of it.  I know your disposition, Lizzy.\\r\\nI know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless\\r\\nyou truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him\\r\\nas a superior.  Your lively talents would place you in the\\r\\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage.  You could scarcely\\r\\nescape discredit and misery.  My child, let me not have the\\r\\ngrief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.\\r\\nYou know not what you are about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her\\r\\nreply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was\\r\\nreally the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual\\r\\nchange which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her\\r\\nabsolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a\\r\\nday, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and\\r\\nenumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer\\r\\nher father\\'s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no\\r\\nmore to say.  If this be the case, he deserves you.  I could\\r\\nnot have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what\\r\\nMr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.  He heard her with\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!  And so, Darcy did\\r\\nevery thing: made up the match, gave the money, paid the\\r\\nfellow\\'s debts, and got him his commission!  So much the\\r\\nbetter.  It will save me a world of trouble and economy.\\r\\nHad it been your uncle\\'s doing, I must and would have paid\\r\\nhim; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their\\r\\nown way.  I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant\\r\\nand storm about his love for you, and there will be an end\\r\\nof the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his\\r\\nreading Mr. Collins\\'s letter; and after laughing at her some\\r\\ntime, allowed her at last to go -- saying, as she quitted the\\r\\nroom, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in,\\r\\nfor I am quite at leisure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight;\\r\\nand, after half an hour\\'s quiet reflection in her own room,\\r\\nshe was able to join the others with tolerable composure.\\r\\nEvery thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed\\r\\ntranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to\\r\\nbe dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would\\r\\ncome in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she\\r\\nfollowed her, and made the important communication.  Its effect\\r\\nwas most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.  Nor was it\\r\\nunder many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she\\r\\nheard; though not in general backward to credit what was for\\r\\nthe advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\\r\\nlover to any of them.  She began at length to recover, to\\r\\nfidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder,\\r\\nand bless herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Lord bless me!  only think!  dear me!\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  Who would have thought it!  And is it really true?\\r\\nOh!  my sweetest Lizzy!  how rich and how great you will be!\\r\\nWhat pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!\\r\\nJane\\'s is nothing to it -- nothing at all.  I am so pleased --\\r\\nso happy.  Such a charming man! -- so handsome!  so tall! --\\r\\nOh, my dear Lizzy!  pray apologise for my having disliked him\\r\\nso much before.  I hope he will overlook it.  Dear, dear Lizzy.\\r\\nA house in town!  Every thing that is charming!  Three\\r\\ndaughters married!  Ten thousand a year!  Oh, Lord!  What will\\r\\nbecome of me.  I shall go distracted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be\\r\\ndoubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was\\r\\nheard only by herself, soon went away.  But before she had\\r\\nbeen three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else!\\r\\nTen thousand a year, and very likely more!  \\'Tis as good as a\\r\\nLord!  And a special licence.  You must and shall be married\\r\\nby a special licence.  But my dearest love, tell me what dish\\r\\nMr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it\\r\\ntomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother\\'s behaviour to the\\r\\ngentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in\\r\\nthe certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of\\r\\nher relations\\' consent, there was still something to be wished\\r\\nfor.  But the morrow passed off much better than she expected;\\r\\nfor Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended\\r\\nson-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was\\r\\nin her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference\\r\\nfor his opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking\\r\\npains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured\\r\\nher that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he.\\r\\n\"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall\\r\\nlike your husband quite as well as Jane\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 60\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH\\'S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she\\r\\nwanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love\\r\\nwith her.  \"How could you begin?\" said she.  \"I can comprehend\\r\\nyour going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning;\\r\\nbut what could set you off in the first place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\\r\\nwords, which laid the foundation.  It is too long ago.  I was\\r\\nin the middle before I knew that I had begun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners --\\r\\nmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the\\r\\nuncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to\\r\\ngive you pain than not.  Now be sincere; did you admire me for\\r\\nmy impertinence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once.  It was very\\r\\nlittle less.  The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of\\r\\ndeference, of officious attention.  You were disgusted with the\\r\\nwomen who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for\\r\\nyour approbation alone.  I roused, and interested you,\\r\\nbecause I was so unlike them.  Had you not been really\\r\\namiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the\\r\\npains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always\\r\\nnoble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the\\r\\npersons who so assiduously courted you.  There -- I have saved\\r\\nyou the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things\\r\\nconsidered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.  To be\\r\\nsure, you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of\\r\\nthat when they fall in love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while\\r\\nshe was ill at Netherfield?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dearest Jane!  who could have done less for her?  But make a\\r\\nvirtue of it by all means.  My good qualities are under your\\r\\nprotection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;\\r\\nand, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing\\r\\nand quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin\\r\\ndirectly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to\\r\\nthe point at last.  What made you so shy of me, when you first\\r\\ncalled, and afterwards dined here?  Why, especially, when you\\r\\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no\\r\\nencouragement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so was I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,\\r\\nand that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!  But I\\r\\nwonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left\\r\\nto yourself.  I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had\\r\\nnot asked you!  My resolution of thanking you for your kindness\\r\\nto Lydia had certainly great effect.  Too much, I am\\r\\nafraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs\\r\\nfrom a breach of promise?  for I ought not to have mentioned\\r\\nthe subject.  This will never do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not distress yourself.  The moral will be perfectly\\r\\nfair.  Lady Catherine\\'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us\\r\\nwere the means of removing all my doubts.  I am not indebted\\r\\nfor my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing\\r\\nyour gratitude.  I was not in a humour to wait for any opening\\r\\nof your\\'s.  My aunt\\'s intelligence had given me hope, and I was\\r\\ndetermined at once to know every thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make\\r\\nher happy, for she loves to be of use.  But tell me, what did\\r\\nyou come down to Netherfield for?  Was it merely to ride to\\r\\nLongbourn and be embarrassed?  or had you intended any more\\r\\nserious consequence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could,\\r\\nwhether I might ever hope to make you love me.  My avowed one,\\r\\nor what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were\\r\\nstill partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the\\r\\nconfession to him which I have since made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine\\r\\nwhat is to befall her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth.\\r\\nBut it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper,\\r\\nit shall be done directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\\r\\nand admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady\\r\\nonce did.  But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer\\r\\nneglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with\\r\\nMr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet\\r\\nanswered Mrs. Gardiner\\'s long letter; but now, having that\\r\\nto communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was\\r\\nalmost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost\\r\\nthree days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought\\r\\nto have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\\r\\nparticulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.\\r\\nYou supposed more than really existed.  But now suppose as\\r\\nmuch as you choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your\\r\\nimagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\r\\nafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot\\r\\ngreatly err.  You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\r\\ngreat deal more than you did in your last.  I thank you, again\\r\\nand again, for not going to the Lakes.  How could I be so silly\\r\\nas to wish it!  Your idea of the ponies is delightful.  We will\\r\\ngo round the Park every day.  I am the happiest creature in the\\r\\nworld.  Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one\\r\\nwith such justice.  I am happier even than Jane; she only\\r\\nsmiles, I laugh.  Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world\\r\\nthat he can spare from me.  You are all to come to Pemberley at\\r\\nChristmas.  Your\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;\\r\\nand still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to\\r\\nMr. Collins, in reply to his last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\r\\n\\r\\nI must trouble you once more for congratulations.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwill soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.  Console Lady Catherine\\r\\nas well as you can.  But, if I were you, I would stand by the\\r\\nnephew.  He has more to give.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s sincerely, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s congratulations to her brother, on his\\r\\napproaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and\\r\\ninsincere.  She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express\\r\\nher delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.\\r\\nJane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling\\r\\nno reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder\\r\\nanswer than she knew was deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar\\r\\ninformation, was as sincere as her brother\\'s in sending it.\\r\\nFour sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her\\r\\ndelight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any\\r\\ncongratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn\\r\\nfamily heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas\\r\\nlodge.  The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.\\r\\nLady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by\\r\\nthe contents of her nephew\\'s letter, that Charlotte, really\\r\\nrejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the\\r\\nstorm was blown over.  At such a moment, the arrival of\\r\\nher friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in\\r\\nthe course of their meetings she must sometimes think the\\r\\npleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all\\r\\nthe parading and obsequious civility of her husband.  He bore\\r\\nit, however, with admirable calmness.  He could even listen to\\r\\nSir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\r\\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of\\r\\ntheir all meeting frequently at St. James\\'s, with very decent\\r\\ncomposure.  If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir\\r\\nWilliam was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips\\'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater,\\r\\ntax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as\\r\\nher sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the\\r\\nfamiliarity which Bingley\\'s good humour encouraged, yet,\\r\\nwhenever she did speak, she must be vulgar.  Nor was her\\r\\nrespect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely\\r\\nto make her more elegant.  Elizabeth did all she could to\\r\\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever\\r\\nanxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with\\r\\nwhom he might converse without mortification; and though the\\r\\nuncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the\\r\\nseason of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope\\r\\nof the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time\\r\\nwhen they should be removed from society so little pleasing to\\r\\neither, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party\\r\\nat Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 61\\r\\n\\r\\nHAPPY for all her maternal feelings was the day on which\\r\\nMrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\r\\nWith what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley,\\r\\nand talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.  I wish I could say,\\r\\nfor the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her\\r\\nearnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children\\r\\nproduced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,\\r\\nwell-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it\\r\\nwas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\\r\\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally\\r\\nnervous and invariably silly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his\\r\\naffection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing\\r\\nelse could do.  He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially\\r\\nwhen he was least expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a\\r\\ntwelvemonth.  So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton\\r\\nrelations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her\\r\\naffectionate heart.  The darling wish of his sisters was then\\r\\ngratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to\\r\\nDerbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other\\r\\nsource of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\\r\\ntime with her two elder sisters.  In society so superior to\\r\\nwhat she had generally known, her improvement was great.  She\\r\\nwas not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from\\r\\nthe influence of Lydia\\'s example, she became, by proper\\r\\nattention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and\\r\\nless insipid.  From the farther disadvantage of Lydia\\'s society\\r\\nshe was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\\r\\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the\\r\\npromise of balls and young men, her father would never consent\\r\\nto her going.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was\\r\\nnecessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s being quite unable to sit alone.  Mary was\\r\\nobliged to mix more with the world, but she could still\\r\\nmoralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer\\r\\nmortified by comparisons between her sisters\\' beauty and her\\r\\nown, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to\\r\\nthe change without much reluctance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no\\r\\nrevolution from the marriage of her sisters.  He bore with\\r\\nphilosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become\\r\\nacquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood\\r\\nhad before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing,\\r\\nwas not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed\\r\\non to make his fortune.  The congratulatory letter which\\r\\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to\\r\\nher that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a\\r\\nhope was cherished.  The letter was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish you joy.  If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my\\r\\ndear Wickham, you must be very happy.  It is a great comfort to\\r\\nhave you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope\\r\\nyou will think of us.  I am sure Wickham would like a place at\\r\\ncourt very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money\\r\\nenough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of\\r\\nabout three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak\\r\\nto Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she\\r\\nendeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty\\r\\nand expectation of the kind.  Such relief, however, as it\\r\\nwas in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be\\r\\ncalled economy in her own private expences, she frequently\\r\\nsent them.  It had always been evident to her that such an\\r\\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so\\r\\nextravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must\\r\\nbe very insufficient to their support; and whenever they\\r\\nchanged their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of\\r\\nbeing applied to for some little assistance towards discharging\\r\\ntheir bills.  Their manner of living, even when the restoration\\r\\nof peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\r\\nextreme.  They were always moving from place to place in quest\\r\\nof a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.\\r\\nHis affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her\\'s lasted\\r\\na little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she\\r\\nretained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had\\r\\ngiven her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.\\r\\nLydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was\\r\\ngone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys\\r\\nthey both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\\'s\\r\\ngood humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk\\r\\nof giving them a hint to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\'s marriage; but\\r\\nas she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at\\r\\nPemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever\\r\\nof Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and\\r\\npaid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nPemberley was now Georgiana\\'s home; and the attachment of the\\r\\nsisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.  They were\\r\\nable to love each other even as well as they intended.\\r\\nGeorgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;\\r\\nthough at first she often listened with an astonishment\\r\\nbordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking\\r\\nto her brother.  He, who had always inspired in herself a\\r\\nrespect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the\\r\\nobject of open pleasantry.  Her mind received knowledge which\\r\\nhad never before fallen in her way.  By Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\ninstructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take\\r\\nliberties with her husband which a brother will not always\\r\\nallow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her\\r\\nnephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her\\r\\ncharacter in her reply to the letter which announced its\\r\\narrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially\\r\\nof Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.\\r\\nBut at length, by Elizabeth\\'s persuasion, he was prevailed on\\r\\nto overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after\\r\\na little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\r\\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her\\r\\ncuriosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she\\r\\ncondescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that\\r\\npollution which its woods had received, not merely from the\\r\\npresence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and\\r\\naunt from the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate\\r\\nterms.  Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and\\r\\nthey were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards\\r\\nthe persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the\\r\\nmeans of uniting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

This\\r\\nwas the page at which the favourite volume always opened:\\r\\n\\r\\n           \"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,\\r\\ndaughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of\\r\\nGloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born\\r\\nJune 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5,\\r\\n1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer\\'s\\r\\nhands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of\\r\\nhimself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary\\'s birth--\\r\\n\"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove,\\r\\nEsq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\" and by inserting most\\r\\naccurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable\\r\\nfamily, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;\\r\\nhow mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,\\r\\nrepresenting a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of\\r\\nloyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with\\r\\nall the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two\\r\\nhandsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and\\r\\nmotto:--\"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,\" and\\r\\nSir Walter\\'s handwriting again in this finale:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the\\r\\nsecond Sir Walter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot\\'s character;\\r\\nvanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome in\\r\\nhis youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.  Few women\\r\\ncould think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could\\r\\nthe valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held\\r\\nin society.  He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to\\r\\nthe blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united\\r\\nthese gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and\\r\\ndevotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since\\r\\nto them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any\\r\\nthing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,\\r\\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\\r\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never\\r\\nrequired indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or\\r\\nconcealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for\\r\\nseventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world\\r\\nherself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children,\\r\\nto attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her\\r\\nwhen she was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest\\r\\nsixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an\\r\\nawful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a\\r\\nconceited, silly father.  She had, however, one very intimate friend, a\\r\\nsensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment\\r\\nto herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on\\r\\nher kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help\\r\\nand maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had\\r\\nbeen anxiously giving her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\\r\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years had\\r\\npassed away since Lady Elliot\\'s death, and they were still near\\r\\nneighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other\\r\\na widow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well\\r\\nprovided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no\\r\\napology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\r\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but\\r\\nSir Walter\\'s continuing in singleness requires explanation.  Be it\\r\\nknown then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one\\r\\nor two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\\r\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters\\' sake.  For\\r\\none daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\\r\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had\\r\\nsucceeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother\\'s rights\\r\\nand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her\\r\\ninfluence had always been great, and they had gone on together most\\r\\nhappily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.  Mary had\\r\\nacquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles\\r\\nMusgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of\\r\\ncharacter, which must have placed her high with any people of real\\r\\nunderstanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no\\r\\nweight, her convenience was always to give way--she was only Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\\r\\ngod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all; but\\r\\nit was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her\\r\\nbloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had\\r\\nfound little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate\\r\\nfeatures and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in\\r\\nthem, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem. He had\\r\\nnever indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in\\r\\nany other page of his favourite work.  All equality of alliance must\\r\\nrest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old\\r\\ncountry family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore\\r\\ngiven all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or\\r\\nother, marry suitably.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she\\r\\nwas ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\\r\\nneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely\\r\\nany charm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome\\r\\nMiss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter\\r\\nmight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be\\r\\ndeemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming\\r\\nas ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he\\r\\ncould plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance\\r\\nwere growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the\\r\\nneighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow\\'s foot about\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s temples had long been a distress to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\\r\\nThirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and\\r\\ndirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have\\r\\ngiven the idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen years\\r\\nhad she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at\\r\\nhome, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking\\r\\nimmediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and\\r\\ndining-rooms in the country.  Thirteen winters\\' revolving frosts had\\r\\nseen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood\\r\\nafforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled\\r\\nup to London with her father, for a few weeks\\' annual enjoyment of the\\r\\ngreat world.  She had the remembrance of all this, she had the\\r\\nconsciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and\\r\\nsome apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as\\r\\nhandsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and\\r\\nwould have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by\\r\\nbaronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again\\r\\ntake up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\\r\\nbut now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of her\\r\\nown birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\\r\\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\\r\\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and\\r\\npushed it away.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially\\r\\nthe history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.\\r\\nThe heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose\\r\\nrights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\\r\\nin the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to\\r\\nmarry him, and her father had always meant that she should.  He had not\\r\\nbeen known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot\\'s death, Sir\\r\\nWalter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not\\r\\nbeen met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making\\r\\nallowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their\\r\\nspring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr\\r\\nElliot had been forced into the introduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the\\r\\nlaw; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his\\r\\nfavour was confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked\\r\\nof and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.  The\\r\\nfollowing spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\\r\\nagain encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and\\r\\nthe next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing his\\r\\nfortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he\\r\\nhad purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of\\r\\ninferior birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter had resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that he\\r\\nought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so\\r\\npublicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\" he\\r\\nobserved, \"once at Tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of the House of\\r\\nCommons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little\\r\\nregarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as\\r\\nunsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter\\r\\nconsidered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between them had\\r\\nceased.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of\\r\\nseveral years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for\\r\\nhimself, and still more for being her father\\'s heir, and whose strong\\r\\nfamily pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter\\r\\nElliot\\'s eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her\\r\\nfeelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.  Yet so\\r\\nmiserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present\\r\\ntime (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could\\r\\nnot admit him to be worth thinking of again.  The disgrace of his first\\r\\nmarriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it\\r\\nperpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse;\\r\\nbut he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they\\r\\nhad been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most\\r\\nslightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and\\r\\nthe honours which were hereafter to be his own.  This could not be\\r\\npardoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were Elizabeth Elliot\\'s sentiments and sensations; such the cares\\r\\nto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the\\r\\nprosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings\\r\\nto give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle,\\r\\nto fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no\\r\\ntalents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\r\\nadded to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.  She\\r\\nknew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the\\r\\nheavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr\\r\\nShepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was\\r\\ngood, but not equal to Sir Walter\\'s apprehension of the state required\\r\\nin its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,\\r\\nmoderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but\\r\\nwith her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he\\r\\nhad been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible for him to\\r\\nspend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was\\r\\nimperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only\\r\\ngrowing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it\\r\\nbecame vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his\\r\\ndaughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town;\\r\\nhe had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?  Does it occur to\\r\\nyou that there is any one article in which we can retrench?\" and\\r\\nElizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm,\\r\\nset seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed\\r\\nthese two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,\\r\\nand to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which\\r\\nexpedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no\\r\\npresent down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these\\r\\nmeasures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real\\r\\nextent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\\r\\nto confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose of\\r\\ndeeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her\\r\\nfather; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of\\r\\nlessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or\\r\\nrelinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose\\r\\nof; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no\\r\\ndifference.  He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the\\r\\npower, but he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never\\r\\ndisgrace his name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted\\r\\nwhole and entire, as he had received it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the\\r\\nneighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;\\r\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\r\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and\\r\\nreduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence\\r\\nof taste or pride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\\r\\nor his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted\\r\\nby anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and\\r\\nonly begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent\\r\\njudgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully\\r\\nexpected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see\\r\\nfinally adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it\\r\\nmuch serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than of\\r\\nquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this\\r\\ninstance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\\r\\nShe was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\\r\\nbut she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter\\'s feelings, as solicitous\\r\\nfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what was\\r\\ndue to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.  She was a\\r\\nbenevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments,\\r\\nmost correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with\\r\\nmanners that were held a standard of good-breeding.  She had a\\r\\ncultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent;\\r\\nbut she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for\\r\\nrank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those\\r\\nwho possessed them.  Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave the\\r\\ndignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his\\r\\nclaims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging\\r\\nlandlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne and\\r\\nher sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to\\r\\na great deal of compassion and consideration under his present\\r\\ndifficulties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was very\\r\\nanxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and\\r\\nElizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,\\r\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne, who\\r\\nnever seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the\\r\\nquestion. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in\\r\\nmarking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to\\r\\nSir Walter. Every emendation of Anne\\'s had been on the side of honesty\\r\\nagainst importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete\\r\\nreformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of\\r\\nindifference for everything but justice and equity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we can persuade your father to all this,\" said Lady Russell,\\r\\nlooking over her paper, \"much may be done.  If he will adopt these\\r\\nregulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be able\\r\\nto convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability\\r\\nin itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the\\r\\ntrue dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the\\r\\neyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.  What will\\r\\nhe be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have\\r\\ndone, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case; and\\r\\nit is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as\\r\\nit always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.  We\\r\\nmust be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has\\r\\ncontracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the\\r\\nfeelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\\r\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be\\r\\nproceeding, his friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act\\r\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all\\r\\nthe expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure,\\r\\nand saw no dignity in anything short of it.  She wanted it to be\\r\\nprescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated Lady Russell\\'s influence\\r\\nhighly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own\\r\\nconscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty\\r\\nin persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.  Her\\r\\nknowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the\\r\\nsacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of\\r\\nboth, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell\\'s too gentle\\r\\nreductions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Anne\\'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little\\r\\nconsequence.  Lady Russell\\'s had no success at all: could not be put up\\r\\nwith, were not to be borne. \"What! every comfort of life knocked off!\\r\\nJourneys, London, servants, horses, table--contractions and\\r\\nrestrictions every where!  To live no longer with the decencies even of\\r\\na private gentleman!  No, he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once,\\r\\nthan remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quit Kellynch Hall.\"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr\\r\\nShepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter\\'s\\r\\nretrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done\\r\\nwithout a change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the\\r\\nvery quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in\\r\\nconfessing his judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not\\r\\nappear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of\\r\\nliving in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient\\r\\ndignity to support.  In any other place Sir Walter might judge for\\r\\nhimself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in\\r\\nwhatever way he might choose to model his household.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of\\r\\ndoubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go was\\r\\nsettled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in\\r\\nthe country.  All Anne\\'s wishes had been for the latter.  A small house\\r\\nin their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell\\'s\\r\\nsociety, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes\\r\\nseeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her\\r\\nambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having something\\r\\nvery opposite from her inclination fixed on.  She disliked Bath, and\\r\\ndid not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt\\r\\nthat he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to\\r\\ndissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer\\r\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\\r\\nat comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath over\\r\\nLondon had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\\r\\ndistance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell\\'s spending\\r\\nsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of\\r\\nLady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for\\r\\nBath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should\\r\\nlose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne\\'s known wishes.  It\\r\\nwould be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in\\r\\nhis own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found the\\r\\nmortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter\\'s\\r\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne\\'s\\r\\ndislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\\r\\nfirst, from the circumstance of her having been three years at school\\r\\nthere, after her mother\\'s death; and secondly, from her happening to be\\r\\nnot in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards\\r\\nspent there with herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must\\r\\nsuit them all; and as to her young friend\\'s health, by passing all the\\r\\nwarm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided;\\r\\nand it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits\\r\\ngood.  Anne had been too little from home, too little seen. Her spirits\\r\\nwere not high.  A larger society would improve them.  She wanted her to\\r\\nbe more known.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for\\r\\nSir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very\\r\\nmaterial part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the\\r\\nbeginning.  He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the\\r\\nhands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir\\r\\nWalter\\'s have found too much.  Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This,\\r\\nhowever, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own\\r\\ncircle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to\\r\\ndesign letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\\r\\n\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned the\\r\\nidea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\\r\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on the\\r\\nsupposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\r\\nunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\\r\\nthat he would let it at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell\\r\\nhad another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir\\r\\nWalter and his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had\\r\\nbeen lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\\r\\nIt was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an\\r\\nunprosperous marriage, to her father\\'s house, with the additional\\r\\nburden of two children.  She was a clever young woman, who understood\\r\\nthe art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall;\\r\\nand who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been\\r\\nalready staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady\\r\\nRussell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of\\r\\ncaution and reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and\\r\\nseemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because\\r\\nElizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more than\\r\\noutward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had\\r\\nnever succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry, against\\r\\nprevious inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying\\r\\nto get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the\\r\\ninjustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut\\r\\nher out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth\\r\\nthe advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in\\r\\nvain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in\\r\\nmore decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs\\r\\nClay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her\\r\\naffection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her\\r\\nbut the object of distant civility.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell\\'s estimate, a very\\r\\nunequal, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\\r\\nand a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice of\\r\\nmore suitable intimates within Miss Elliot\\'s reach, was therefore an\\r\\nobject of first-rate importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd one\\r\\nmorning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper, \"that the\\r\\npresent juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will be turning all\\r\\nour rich naval officers ashore.  They will be all wanting a home.\\r\\nCould not be a better time, Sir Walter, for having a choice of tenants,\\r\\nvery responsible tenants.  Many a noble fortune has been made during\\r\\nthe war.  If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sir Walter--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,\" replied Sir Walter; \"that\\'s\\r\\nall I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him;\\r\\nrather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken ever so many\\r\\nbefore; hey, Shepherd?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,\\r\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a little\\r\\nknowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess\\r\\nthat they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make\\r\\ndesirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with.\\r\\nTherefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if\\r\\nin consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which\\r\\nmust be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult\\r\\nit is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the\\r\\nnotice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John\\r\\nShepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody\\r\\nwould think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot\\r\\nhas eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; and\\r\\ntherefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise\\r\\nme if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get\\r\\nabroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since\\r\\napplications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our\\r\\nwealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave\\r\\nto add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the\\r\\ntrouble of replying.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the\\r\\nroom, he observed sarcastically--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would\\r\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"\\r\\nsaid Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her\\r\\nover, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay\\'s health as a drive to\\r\\nKellynch: \"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might\\r\\nbe a very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the\\r\\nprofession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\\r\\nin all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, if\\r\\nyou chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in and\\r\\nabout the house would be taken such excellent care of!  The gardens and\\r\\nshrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now.  You\\r\\nneed not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens being\\r\\nneglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced\\r\\nto let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the\\r\\nprivileges to be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to\\r\\nfavour a tenant.  The park would be open to him of course, and few navy\\r\\nofficers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range;\\r\\nbut what restrictions I might impose on the use of the\\r\\npleasure-grounds, is another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my\\r\\nshrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend Miss\\r\\nElliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden.  I am very\\r\\nlittle disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary\\r\\nfavour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything\\r\\nplain and easy between landlord and tenant.  Your interest, Sir Walter,\\r\\nis in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant\\r\\nhas more than his just rights.  I venture to hint, that Sir Walter\\r\\nElliot cannot be half so jealous for his own, as John Shepherd will be\\r\\nfor him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Anne spoke--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an\\r\\nequal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the\\r\\nprivileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough for their\\r\\ncomforts, we must all allow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,\" was Mr\\r\\nShepherd\\'s rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter\\'s; but Sir\\r\\nWalter\\'s remark was, soon afterwards--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any\\r\\nfriend of mine belonging to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of\\r\\nobjection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons of\\r\\nobscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which\\r\\ntheir fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it\\r\\ncuts up a man\\'s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\\r\\nsooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.  A man is\\r\\nin greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one\\r\\nwhose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of\\r\\nbecoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other\\r\\nline.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men,\\r\\nstriking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father\\r\\nwe all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was\\r\\nto give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most\\r\\ndeplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of\\r\\nmahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles,\\r\\nnine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top.  \\'In\\r\\nthe name of heaven, who is that old fellow?\\' said I to a friend of mine\\r\\nwho was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley).  \\'Old fellow!\\' cried Sir\\r\\nBasil, \\'it is Admiral Baldwin.  What do you take his age to be?\\'\\r\\n\\'Sixty,\\' said I, \\'or perhaps sixty-two.\\' \\'Forty,\\' replied Sir Basil,\\r\\n\\'forty, and no more.\\'  Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not\\r\\neasily forget Admiral Baldwin.  I never saw quite so wretched an\\r\\nexample of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is\\r\\nthe same with them all:  they are all knocked about, and exposed to\\r\\nevery climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen.  It\\r\\nis a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach\\r\\nAdmiral Baldwin\\'s age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Sir Walter,\" cried Mrs Clay, \"this is being severe indeed.  Have\\r\\na little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.\\r\\nThe sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I\\r\\nhave observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then, is not\\r\\nit the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?  Soldiers,\\r\\nin active service, are not at all better off:  and even in the quieter\\r\\nprofessions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the\\r\\nbody, which seldom leaves a man\\'s looks to the natural effect of time.\\r\\nThe lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours,\\r\\nand travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman--\" she stopt a\\r\\nmoment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--\"and even the\\r\\nclergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose\\r\\nhis health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In\\r\\nfact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is\\r\\nnecessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who\\r\\nare not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the\\r\\ncountry, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and\\r\\nliving on their own property, without the torment of trying for more;\\r\\nit is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good\\r\\nappearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose\\r\\nsomething of their personableness when they cease to be quite young.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter\\'s\\r\\ngood will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with\\r\\nforesight; for the very first application for the house was from an\\r\\nAdmiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in\\r\\nattending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he had received\\r\\na hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.  By the report which\\r\\nhe hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native of\\r\\nSomersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishing\\r\\nto settle in his own country, and had come down to Taunton in order to\\r\\nlook at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which,\\r\\nhowever, had not suited him; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as\\r\\nhe had foretold, Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter\\'s concerns could not\\r\\nbe kept a secret,)--accidentally hearing of the possibility of\\r\\nKellynch Hall being to let, and understanding his (Mr Shepherd\\'s)\\r\\nconnection with the owner, he had introduced himself to him in order to\\r\\nmake particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty long\\r\\nconference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man\\r\\nwho knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in\\r\\nhis explicit account of himself, every proof of his being a most\\r\\nresponsible, eligible tenant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter\\'s cold suspicious inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman\\'s family, and\\r\\nmentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,\\r\\nadded--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,\\r\\nand has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, I\\r\\nbelieve, several years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I take it for granted,\" observed Sir Walter, \"that his face is\\r\\nabout as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,\\r\\nhearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not\\r\\nmuch, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; not\\r\\nlikely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a\\r\\ncomfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he must\\r\\npay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that\\r\\nconsequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter\\r\\nhad asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the\\r\\ndeputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimes\\r\\ntook out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the\\r\\ncircumstances of the Admiral\\'s family, which made him peculiarly\\r\\ndesirable as a tenant.  He was a married man, and without children; the\\r\\nvery state to be wished for.  A house was never taken good care of, Mr\\r\\nShepherd observed, without a lady: he did not know, whether furniture\\r\\nmight not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady, as\\r\\nwhere there were many children.  A lady, without a family, was the very\\r\\nbest preserver of furniture in the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too;\\r\\nshe was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all\\r\\nthe time they were talking the matter over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"\\r\\ncontinued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms, and\\r\\ntaxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with\\r\\nbusiness; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite\\r\\nunconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,\\r\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she told me\\r\\nso herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at\\r\\nMonkford. Bless me! what was his name? At this moment I cannot\\r\\nrecollect his name, though I have heard it so lately. Penelope, my\\r\\ndear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at\\r\\nMonkford: Mrs Croft\\'s brother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not\\r\\nhear the appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember no\\r\\ngentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.\\r\\nA name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman so\\r\\nwell by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once, I\\r\\nremember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer\\'s man\\r\\nbreaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in the\\r\\nfact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to an\\r\\namicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter waiting another moment--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?\" said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Shepherd was all gratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.  He had\\r\\nthe curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, for two\\r\\nor three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it.  You\\r\\nremember him, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.  You misled\\r\\nme by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of some man of\\r\\nproperty:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite unconnected;\\r\\nnothing to do with the Strafford family.  One wonders how the names of\\r\\nmany of our nobility become so common.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no\\r\\nservice with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning, with all\\r\\nhis zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their\\r\\nfavour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea they had\\r\\nformed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the advantage of\\r\\nrenting it; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the\\r\\nhappiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot: an extraordinary\\r\\ntaste, certainly, could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir\\r\\nWalter\\'s estimate of the dues of a tenant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an\\r\\nevil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them\\r\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest\\r\\nterms, he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the\\r\\ntreaty, and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still\\r\\nremained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough of the\\r\\nworld to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant, in all essentials,\\r\\nthan Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.  So far went his\\r\\nunderstanding; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing, in\\r\\nthe Admiral\\'s situation in life, which was just high enough, and not\\r\\ntoo high.  \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\" would sound\\r\\nextremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--; a Mr (save,\\r\\nperhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs a note of\\r\\nexplanation.  An admiral speaks his own consequence, and, at the same\\r\\ntime, can never make a baronet look small.  In all their dealings and\\r\\nintercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth: but her\\r\\ninclination was growing so strong for a removal, that she was happy to\\r\\nhave it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand; and not a word to\\r\\nsuspend decision was uttered by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had such an\\r\\nend been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener to\\r\\nthe whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\r\\nflushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said, with a\\r\\ngentle sigh, \"A few months more, and he, perhaps, may be walking here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however\\r\\nsuspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his\\r\\nbrother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off St\\r\\nDomingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, in\\r\\nthe summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for half\\r\\na year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man,\\r\\nwith a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anne an\\r\\nextremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling.\\r\\nHalf the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, for\\r\\nhe had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love; but the\\r\\nencounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.  They were\\r\\ngradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love.\\r\\nIt would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the\\r\\nother, or which had been the happiest: she, in receiving his\\r\\ndeclarations and proposals, or he in having them accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.\\r\\nTroubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually\\r\\nwithholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all the\\r\\nnegative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence, and a\\r\\nprofessed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.  He thought it\\r\\na very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with more tempered\\r\\nand pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throw\\r\\nherself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement\\r\\nwith a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend him, and no\\r\\nhopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertain\\r\\nprofession, and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the\\r\\nprofession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which she grieved to\\r\\nthink of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few, to be snatched off\\r\\nby a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him into a\\r\\nstate of most wearing, anxious, youth-killing dependence!  It must not\\r\\nbe, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations from\\r\\none who had almost a mother\\'s love, and mother\\'s rights, it would be\\r\\nprevented.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;\\r\\nbut spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.  But\\r\\nhe was confident that he should soon be rich: full of life and ardour,\\r\\nhe knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that\\r\\nwould lead to everything he wanted.  He had always been lucky; he knew\\r\\nhe should be so still.  Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth,\\r\\nand bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have been\\r\\nenough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His\\r\\nsanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on\\r\\nher.  She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a\\r\\ndangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong.\\r\\nLady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to\\r\\nimprudence a horror.  She deprecated the connexion in every light.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anne could\\r\\ncombat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet have been possible\\r\\nto withstand her father\\'s ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word\\r\\nor look on the part of her sister; but Lady Russell, whom she had\\r\\nalways loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion,\\r\\nand such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her in vain.\\r\\nShe was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet,\\r\\nimproper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it.  But it was\\r\\nnot a merely selfish caution, under which she acted, in putting an end\\r\\nto it.  Had she not imagined herself consulting his good, even more\\r\\nthan her own, she could hardly have given him up.  The belief of being\\r\\nprudent, and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief\\r\\nconsolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every\\r\\nconsolation was required, for she had to encounter all the additional\\r\\npain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and\\r\\nof his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He had\\r\\nleft the country in consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;\\r\\nbut not with a few months ended Anne\\'s share of suffering from it.  Her\\r\\nattachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of\\r\\nyouth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting\\r\\neffect.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful\\r\\ninterest had reached its close; and time had softened down much,\\r\\nperhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him, but she had been too\\r\\ndependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place\\r\\n(except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any novelty\\r\\nor enlargement of society.  No one had ever come within the Kellynch\\r\\ncircle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he\\r\\nstood in her memory.  No second attachment, the only thoroughly\\r\\nnatural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been\\r\\npossible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste,\\r\\nin the small limits of the society around them.  She had been\\r\\nsolicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her name, by the young\\r\\nman, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger\\r\\nsister; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove\\r\\nwas the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and general\\r\\nimportance were second in that country, only to Sir Walter\\'s, and of\\r\\ngood character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might have\\r\\nasked yet for something more, while Anne was nineteen, she would have\\r\\nrejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the\\r\\npartialities and injustice of her father\\'s house, and settled so\\r\\npermanently near herself.  But in this case, Anne had left nothing for\\r\\nadvice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her\\r\\nown discretion, never wished the past undone, she began now to have the\\r\\nanxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne\\'s being tempted, by some\\r\\nman of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held\\r\\nher to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey knew not each other\\'s opinion, either its constancy or its change,\\r\\non the one leading point of Anne\\'s conduct, for the subject was never\\r\\nalluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently\\r\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen.  She did not blame\\r\\nLady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;\\r\\nbut she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to\\r\\napply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain\\r\\nimmediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.  She was persuaded\\r\\nthat under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every\\r\\nanxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and\\r\\ndisappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in\\r\\nmaintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\\r\\nand this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\\r\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,\\r\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it\\r\\nhappened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be\\r\\nreasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations, all his\\r\\nconfidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour had seemed to\\r\\nforesee and to command his prosperous path.  He had, very soon after\\r\\ntheir engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he had told her would\\r\\nfollow, had taken place.  He had distinguished himself, and early\\r\\ngained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures,\\r\\nhave made a handsome fortune.  She had only navy lists and newspapers\\r\\nfor her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in\\r\\nfavour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least, were\\r\\nher wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful\\r\\nconfidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems\\r\\nto insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced into\\r\\nprudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the\\r\\nnatural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she could not\\r\\nhear that Captain Wentworth\\'s sister was likely to live at Kellynch\\r\\nwithout a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh,\\r\\nwere necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.  She often told\\r\\nherself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves sufficiently\\r\\nto feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no\\r\\nevil.  She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and\\r\\napparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends in\\r\\nthe secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of\\r\\nit.  She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell\\'s motives\\r\\nin this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour all\\r\\nthe better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion\\r\\namong them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the\\r\\nevent of Admiral Croft\\'s really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew\\r\\nover the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of the\\r\\npast being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom no\\r\\nsyllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that\\r\\namong his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, had\\r\\nreceived any information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother\\r\\nhad been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and,\\r\\nmoreover, a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no\\r\\nhuman creature\\'s having heard of it from him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying her\\r\\nhusband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary, had been at\\r\\nschool while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some,\\r\\nand the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\r\\nand the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,\\r\\nand Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not\\r\\ninvolve any particular awkwardness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s seeing Kellynch\\r\\nHall, Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady\\r\\nRussell\\'s, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it\\r\\nmost natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decided\\r\\nthe whole business at once.  Each lady was previously well disposed for\\r\\nan agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in the\\r\\nother; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good\\r\\nhumour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral\\'s side, as\\r\\ncould not but influence Sir Walter, who had besides been flattered into\\r\\nhis very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd\\'s assurances\\r\\nof his being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of good\\r\\nbreeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts were\\r\\napproved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and Mr\\r\\nShepherd\\'s clerks were set to work, without there having been a single\\r\\npreliminary difference to modify of all that \"This indenture sheweth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the\\r\\nbest-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,\\r\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair, he should\\r\\nnot be ashamed of being seen with him any where; and the Admiral, with\\r\\nsympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they drove back through\\r\\nthe park, \"I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite\\r\\nof what they told us at Taunton.  The Baronet will never set the Thames\\r\\non fire, but there seems to be no harm in him.\"--reciprocal\\r\\ncompliments, which would have been esteemed about equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter\\r\\nproposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, there\\r\\nwas no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any\\r\\nuse, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were\\r\\ngoing to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,\\r\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\r\\nconvey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements of\\r\\nher own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she was\\r\\nunable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne though dreading\\r\\nthe possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, and\\r\\ngrieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the\\r\\nautumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything\\r\\nconsidered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right, and most\\r\\nwise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething occurred, however, to give her a different duty.  Mary, often\\r\\na little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her own\\r\\ncomplaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was\\r\\nthe matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have a\\r\\nday\\'s health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for it\\r\\nwas hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her\\r\\ncompany as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot possibly do without Anne,\" was Mary\\'s reasoning; and\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s reply was, \"Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody\\r\\nwill want her in Bath.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least\\r\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be\\r\\nthought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and\\r\\ncertainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own\\r\\ndear country, readily agreed to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis invitation of Mary\\'s removed all Lady Russell\\'s difficulties, and\\r\\nit was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till\\r\\nLady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time should be\\r\\ndivided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled by\\r\\nthe wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her,\\r\\nwhich was, Mrs Clay\\'s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and\\r\\nElizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in\\r\\nall the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry that\\r\\nsuch a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved,\\r\\nand feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in Mrs Clay\\'s being\\r\\nof so much use, while Anne could be of none, was a very sore\\r\\naggravation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt the\\r\\nimprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.  With a\\r\\ngreat deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she often\\r\\nwished less, of her father\\'s character, she was sensible that results\\r\\nthe most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than\\r\\npossible.  She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea\\r\\nof the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a\\r\\nclumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in\\r\\nher absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking,\\r\\nand possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners,\\r\\ninfinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might\\r\\nhave been.  Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that\\r\\nshe could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her\\r\\nsister.  She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the\\r\\nevent of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than\\r\\nherself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for\\r\\ngiving no warning.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive how\\r\\nsuch an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered\\r\\nfor each party\\'s perfectly knowing their situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is; and as I am\\r\\nrather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can\\r\\nassure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly\\r\\nnice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more\\r\\nstrongly than most people.  And as to my father, I really should not\\r\\nhave thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our\\r\\nsakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman,\\r\\nI grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that\\r\\nanything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a\\r\\ndegrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay\\r\\nwho, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably\\r\\npretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect\\r\\nsafety.  One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her\\r\\npersonal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times.  That tooth\\r\\nof her\\'s and those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much\\r\\nas they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a\\r\\nfew, but he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay\\'s\\r\\nfreckles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne, \"which an\\r\\nagreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly; \"an agreeable\\r\\nmanner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones.\\r\\nHowever, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this\\r\\npoint than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you\\r\\nto be advising me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of\\r\\ndoing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be\\r\\nmade observant by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,\\r\\nMiss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath. The party drove off in very good\\r\\nspirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the\\r\\nafflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show\\r\\nthemselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate\\r\\ntranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt\\r\\nthis break-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was as\\r\\ndear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by\\r\\nhabit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still\\r\\nworse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape\\r\\nthe solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out\\r\\nof the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived, she had determined\\r\\nto make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne.\\r\\nAccordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at\\r\\nUppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell\\'s journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nUppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had\\r\\nbeen completely in the old English style, containing only two houses\\r\\nsuperior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the\\r\\nmansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\\r\\nsubstantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\\r\\nenclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained\\r\\nround its casements; but upon the marriage of the young \\'squire, it had\\r\\nreceived the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for\\r\\nhis residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French\\r\\nwindows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the\\r\\ntraveller\\'s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and\\r\\npremises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Anne had often been staying. She knew the ways of Uppercross as\\r\\nwell as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continually\\r\\nmeeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other\\'s\\r\\nhouse at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary\\r\\nalone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\r\\na matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary\\r\\nhad not Anne\\'s understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and\\r\\nproperly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\\r\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely. She had no resources for\\r\\nsolitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot\\r\\nself-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of\\r\\nfancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she was inferior to\\r\\nboth sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity of\\r\\nbeing \"a fine girl.\" She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty\\r\\nlittle drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been\\r\\ngradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two\\r\\nchildren; and, on Anne\\'s appearing, greeted her with--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.  I\\r\\nam so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature the whole\\r\\nmorning!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.  \"You sent me such a\\r\\ngood account of yourself on Thursday!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well\\r\\nat the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have\\r\\nbeen all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.\\r\\nSuppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not\\r\\nable to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.  I do not\\r\\nthink she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.  \"Oh!\\r\\nCharles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o\\'clock.  He\\r\\nwould go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not stay\\r\\nout long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.  I\\r\\nassure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have had your little boys with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\\r\\nthat they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind a\\r\\nword I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully.  \"You\\r\\nknow I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours at the\\r\\nGreat House?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them\\r\\nto-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the\\r\\nwindow, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how\\r\\nill I was, not one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to\\r\\nsuit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out\\r\\nof their way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.  It is\\r\\nearly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal too\\r\\nmuch for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind of\\r\\nyou not to come on Thursday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of\\r\\nyourself!  You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were\\r\\nperfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you\\r\\nmust be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the\\r\\nlast: and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so\\r\\nbusy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have\\r\\nleft Kellynch sooner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect in a\\r\\nmoment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making a duplicate of the\\r\\ncatalogue of my father\\'s books and pictures.  I have been several times\\r\\nin the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make him\\r\\nunderstand, which of Elizabeth\\'s plants are for Lady Russell.  I have\\r\\nhad all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide,\\r\\nand all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what\\r\\nwas intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary,\\r\\nof a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as\\r\\na sort of take-leave.  I was told that they wished it.  But all these\\r\\nthings took up a great deal of time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! well!\" and after a moment\\'s pause, \"but you have never asked me\\r\\none word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you\\r\\nmust have been obliged to give up the party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter\\r\\nwith me till this morning.  It would have been strange if I had not\\r\\ngone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant\\r\\nparty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will\\r\\nbe, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a\\r\\ncarriage of one\\'s own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were so\\r\\ncrowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr\\r\\nMusgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into the back\\r\\nseat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely that my\\r\\nillness to-day may be owing to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on\\r\\nAnne\\'s side produced nearly a cure on Mary\\'s.  She could soon sit\\r\\nupright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able to leave it by\\r\\ndinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it, she was at the other end\\r\\nof the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, she ate her cold meat; and\\r\\nthen she was well enough to propose a little walk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"I suppose you\\r\\nwill not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne.  \"I\\r\\nshould never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so\\r\\nwell as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.  They ought\\r\\nto feel what is due to you as my sister.  However, we may as well go\\r\\nand sit with them a little  while, and when we have that over, we can\\r\\nenjoy our walk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\\r\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\\r\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither\\r\\nfamily could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly they\\r\\nwent, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\\r\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters\\r\\nof the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a\\r\\ngrand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in\\r\\nevery direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits against the\\r\\nwainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue\\r\\nsatin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an\\r\\noverthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves seemed\\r\\nto be staring in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\\r\\nperhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old English\\r\\nstyle, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a\\r\\nvery good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated,\\r\\nand not at all elegant.  Their children had more modern minds and\\r\\nmanners.  There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up,\\r\\nexcepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen\\r\\nand twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock\\r\\nof accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies,\\r\\nliving to be fashionable, happy, and merry.  Their dress had every\\r\\nadvantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely\\r\\ngood, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence\\r\\nat home, and favourites abroad.  Anne always contemplated them as some\\r\\nof the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we\\r\\nall are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for\\r\\nthe possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more\\r\\nelegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them\\r\\nnothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement\\r\\ntogether, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\\r\\nso little herself with either of her sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss on the\\r\\nside of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anne very well\\r\\nknew, the least to blame.  The half hour was chatted away pleasantly\\r\\nenough; and she was not at all surprised, at the end of it, to have\\r\\ntheir walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary\\'s\\r\\nparticular invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal\\r\\nfrom one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three\\r\\nmiles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and\\r\\nidea.  She had never been staying there before, without being struck by\\r\\nit, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in\\r\\nseeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at\\r\\nKellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading\\r\\ninterest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she must now\\r\\nsubmit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own\\r\\nnothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her; for\\r\\ncertainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject which\\r\\nhad been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,\\r\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in\\r\\nthe separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: \"So, Miss\\r\\nAnne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you\\r\\nthink they will settle in?\" and this, without much waiting for an\\r\\nanswer; or in the young ladies\\' addition of, \"I hope we shall be in\\r\\nBath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a\\r\\ngood situation:  none of your Queen Squares for us!\" or in the anxious\\r\\nsupplement from Mary, of--\"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off,\\r\\nwhen you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think\\r\\nwith heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one\\r\\nsuch truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own\\r\\nhorses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully\\r\\noccupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours,\\r\\ndress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be very fitting,\\r\\nthat every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of\\r\\ndiscourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of the\\r\\none she was now transplanted into.  With the prospect of spending at\\r\\nleast two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on her to\\r\\nclothe her imagination, her memory, and all her ideas in as much of\\r\\nUppercross as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive and\\r\\nunsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;\\r\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts of the\\r\\ncottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms with her\\r\\nbrother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and\\r\\nrespected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of\\r\\ninterest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was\\r\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,\\r\\nor grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a\\r\\ndangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe,\\r\\nwith Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improved\\r\\nhim; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more\\r\\nconsequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, and\\r\\nelegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was, he did nothing with\\r\\nmuch zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without\\r\\nbenefit from books or anything else.  He had very good spirits, which\\r\\nnever seemed much affected by his wife\\'s occasional lowness, bore with\\r\\nher unreasonableness sometimes to Anne\\'s admiration, and upon the\\r\\nwhole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she\\r\\nhad sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both\\r\\nparties), they might pass for a happy couple.  They were always\\r\\nperfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination\\r\\nfor a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he\\r\\nhad the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such\\r\\na present was not made, he always contended for his father\\'s having\\r\\nmany other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the management of their children, his theory was much better than\\r\\nhis wife\\'s, and his practice not so bad.  \"I could manage them very\\r\\nwell, if it were not for Mary\\'s interference,\" was what Anne often\\r\\nheard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in\\r\\nturn to Mary\\'s reproach of \"Charles spoils the children so that I\\r\\ncannot get them into any order,\" she never had the smallest temptation\\r\\nto say, \"Very true.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her\\r\\nbeing treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too\\r\\nmuch in the secret of the complaints of each house.  Known to have some\\r\\ninfluence with her sister, she was continually requested, or at least\\r\\nreceiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.  \"I wish you\\r\\ncould persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\" was\\r\\nCharles\\'s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary: \"I do\\r\\nbelieve if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think there was\\r\\nanything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would, you might\\r\\npersuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse than I ever\\r\\nown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary\\'s declaration was, \"I hate sending the children to the Great\\r\\nHouse, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she\\r\\nhumours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much\\r\\ntrash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\r\\nfor the rest of the day.\"  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity\\r\\nof being alone with Anne, to say, \"Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing\\r\\nMrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.  They are\\r\\nquite different creatures with you!  But to be sure, in general they\\r\\nare so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of\\r\\nmanaging them.  They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen,\\r\\npoor little dears! without partiality; but Mrs Charles knows no more\\r\\nhow they should be treated--!  Bless me! how troublesome they are\\r\\nsometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them\\r\\nat our house so often as I otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is\\r\\nnot quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is\\r\\nvery bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\r\\nevery moment; \"don\\'t do this,\" and \"don\\'t do that;\" or that one can\\r\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  \"Mrs Musgrove thinks\\r\\nall her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in\\r\\nquestion; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper\\r\\nhouse-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are\\r\\ngadding about the village, all day long.  I meet them wherever I go;\\r\\nand I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing\\r\\nsomething of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest\\r\\ncreature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells\\r\\nme, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\" And on Mrs\\r\\nMusgrove\\'s side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering in any of\\r\\nmy daughter-in-law\\'s concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall\\r\\ntell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights,\\r\\nthat I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles\\'s nursery-maid: I hear\\r\\nstrange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my own\\r\\nknowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she is\\r\\nenough to ruin any servants she comes near.  Mrs Charles quite swears\\r\\nby her, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the\\r\\nwatch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of\\r\\nmentioning it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, it was Mary\\'s complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to\\r\\ngive her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great\\r\\nHouse with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was\\r\\nto be considered so much at home as to lose her place.  And one day\\r\\nwhen Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after\\r\\ntalking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, \"I have no\\r\\nscruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about\\r\\ntheir place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you\\r\\nare about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would\\r\\nbe a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if\\r\\nshe would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.\\r\\nNobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be\\r\\nmore becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.  It is not that\\r\\nmamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken\\r\\nnotice of by many persons.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little\\r\\nmore than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to\\r\\nthe other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between\\r\\nsuch near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant\\r\\nfor her sister\\'s benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.  Her\\r\\nown spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed\\r\\nthree miles from Kellynch; Mary\\'s ailments lessened by having a\\r\\nconstant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family,\\r\\nsince there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment\\r\\nin the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.  It\\r\\nwas certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every\\r\\nmorning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed\\r\\nthey should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs\\r\\nMusgrove\\'s respectable forms in the usual places, or without the\\r\\ntalking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but\\r\\nhaving no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit\\r\\nby and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought\\r\\nof, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well\\r\\naware.  She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to\\r\\nherself; but this was no new sensation.  Excepting one short period of\\r\\nher life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the\\r\\nloss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or\\r\\nencouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.  In music she had\\r\\nbeen always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s\\r\\nfond partiality for their own daughters\\' performance, and total\\r\\nindifference to any other person\\'s, gave her much more pleasure for\\r\\ntheir sakes, than mortification for her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.\\r\\nThe neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by\\r\\neverybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors\\r\\nby invitation and by chance, than any other family.  They were more\\r\\ncompletely popular.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\\r\\nin an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins within\\r\\na walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on\\r\\nthe Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come at any time,\\r\\nand help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much\\r\\npreferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country\\r\\ndances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always\\r\\nrecommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\r\\nmore than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\"Well done,\\r\\nMiss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!  how those little\\r\\nfingers of yours fly about!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne\\'s heart\\r\\nmust be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others; all the\\r\\nprecious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own\\r\\nother eyes and other limbs!  She could not think of much else on the\\r\\n29th of September; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening\\r\\nfrom Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month,\\r\\nexclaimed, \"Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to\\r\\nKellynch?  I am glad I did not think of it before.  How low it makes\\r\\nme!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be\\r\\nvisited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.  \"Nobody knew how\\r\\nmuch she should suffer.  She should put it off as long as she could;\"\\r\\nbut was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on\\r\\nan early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of\\r\\nimaginary agitation, when she came back.  Anne had very sincerely\\r\\nrejoiced in there being no means of her going.  She wished, however to\\r\\nsee the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.\\r\\nThey came:  the master of the house was not at home, but the two\\r\\nsisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the\\r\\nshare of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very\\r\\nagreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well\\r\\nable to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to\\r\\ncatch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness,\\r\\nand vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.  She had\\r\\nbright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though\\r\\nher reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her\\r\\nhaving been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have\\r\\nlived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\\r\\nHer manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust\\r\\nof herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to\\r\\ncoarseness, however, or any want of good humour.  Anne gave her credit,\\r\\nindeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all\\r\\nthat related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had\\r\\nsatisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of\\r\\nintroduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge\\r\\nor suspicion on Mrs Croft\\'s side, to give a bias of any sort.  She was\\r\\nquite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage,\\r\\ntill for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft\\'s suddenly saying,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the\\r\\npleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\\r\\nshe certainly had not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs\\r\\nCroft\\'s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke,\\r\\nthat she had said nothing which might not do for either brother. She\\r\\nimmediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should be\\r\\nthinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame\\r\\nat her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their\\r\\nformer neighbour\\'s present state with proper interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she\\r\\nheard the Admiral say to Mary--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft\\'s here soon; I dare say you\\r\\nknow him by name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to\\r\\nhim like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too\\r\\nmuch engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets,\\r\\n&c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had\\r\\nbegun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that\\r\\nthe same brother must still be in question.  She could not, however,\\r\\nreach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether\\r\\nanything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the\\r\\nCrofts had previously been calling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at\\r\\nthe Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to\\r\\nbe made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the\\r\\nyoungest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming to apologize,\\r\\nand that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the\\r\\nfirst black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa\\r\\nmade all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave more\\r\\nroom for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.  I am\\r\\ncome on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this\\r\\nevening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Richard!\\r\\nAnd we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse\\r\\nher more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you why she is out of\\r\\nspirits.  When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here\\r\\nafterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her brother,\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or\\r\\nsomething, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most\\r\\nunluckily it came into mamma\\'s head, when they were gone, that\\r\\nWentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard\\'s\\r\\ncaptain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while\\r\\nbefore he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over his letters and\\r\\nthings, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be\\r\\nthe very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!\\r\\nSo we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon\\r\\nsuch gloomy things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\\r\\nthat the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\\r\\nhopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his\\r\\ntwentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and\\r\\nunmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any\\r\\ntime by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard\\r\\nof, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death\\r\\nabroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for\\r\\nhim, by calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a\\r\\nthick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done\\r\\nanything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,\\r\\nliving or dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those\\r\\nremovals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such\\r\\nmidshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on\\r\\nboard Captain Frederick Wentworth\\'s frigate, the Laconia; and from the\\r\\nLaconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only\\r\\ntwo letters which his father and mother had ever received from him\\r\\nduring the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two\\r\\ndisinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for\\r\\nmoney.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little\\r\\nwere they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and\\r\\nincurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made\\r\\nscarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have\\r\\nbeen suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of\\r\\nWentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary\\r\\nbursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the\\r\\nre-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son\\r\\ngone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had\\r\\naffected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for\\r\\nhim than she had known on first hearing of his death.  Mr Musgrove was,\\r\\nin a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the\\r\\ncottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew\\r\\non this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful\\r\\ncompanions could give them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name\\r\\nso often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it\\r\\nmight, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain\\r\\nWentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their\\r\\ncoming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say\\r\\nwhether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to\\r\\nAnne\\'s nerves.  She found, however, that it was one to which she must\\r\\ninure herself.  Since he actually was expected in the country, she must\\r\\nteach herself to be insensible on such points.  And not only did it\\r\\nappear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their\\r\\nwarm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high\\r\\nrespect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick\\'s having been\\r\\nsix months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not\\r\\nperfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow, only two\\r\\nperticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on introducing\\r\\nthemselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of\\r\\nhis arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at\\r\\nKellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his\\r\\npraise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by\\r\\nthe end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment to Mr\\r\\nMusgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was\\r\\nhe to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own\\r\\nroof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his\\r\\ncellars.  But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne\\'s reckoning, and\\r\\nthen, she supposed, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that she\\r\\ncould feel secure even for a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove\\'s civility,\\r\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour.  She and Mary\\r\\nwere actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she\\r\\nafterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him, when they were\\r\\nstopped by the eldest boy\\'s being at that moment brought home in\\r\\nconsequence of a bad fall.  The child\\'s situation put the visit\\r\\nentirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference,\\r\\neven in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on\\r\\nhis account.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in\\r\\nthe back, as roused the most alarming ideas.  It was an afternoon of\\r\\ndistress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to\\r\\nsend for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to\\r\\nsupport and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest\\r\\nchild to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe;\\r\\nbesides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the\\r\\nother house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened,\\r\\nenquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer brother\\'s return was the first comfort; he could take best care of\\r\\nhis wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\\r\\nTill he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the\\r\\nworse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;\\r\\nbut now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt\\r\\nand felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the\\r\\nfather and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be\\r\\nable to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then\\r\\nit was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so\\r\\nfar to digress from their nephew\\'s state, as to give the information of\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s visit; staying five minutes behind their father and\\r\\nmother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with\\r\\nhim, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him\\r\\nthan any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all\\r\\na favourite before.  How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to\\r\\nstay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and\\r\\nhow glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma\\'s\\r\\nfarther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the\\r\\nmorrow--actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant a\\r\\nmanner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he\\r\\nought.  And in short, he had looked and said everything with such\\r\\nexquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both\\r\\nturned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and\\r\\napparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls\\r\\ncame with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make\\r\\nenquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about\\r\\nhis heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would\\r\\nbe now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry\\r\\nto think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the\\r\\nlittle boy, to give him the meeting.  \"Oh no; as to leaving the little\\r\\nboy,\" both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\r\\nto bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help\\r\\nadding her warm protestations to theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; \"the\\r\\nchild was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; he\\r\\nwould not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\" But\\r\\nin this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh! no, indeed,\\r\\nCharles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything\\r\\nshould happen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.  It\\r\\nmust be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the\\r\\nspine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm, and Charles\\r\\nMusgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer\\r\\nconfinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as\\r\\npossible; but what was there for a father to do?  This was quite a\\r\\nfemale case, and it would be highly absurd in him, who could be of no\\r\\nuse at home, to shut himself up.  His father very much wished him to\\r\\nmeet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason against\\r\\nit, he ought to go; and it ended in his making a bold, public\\r\\ndeclaration, when he came in from shooting, of his meaning to dress\\r\\ndirectly, and dine at the other house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he; \"so I told my\\r\\nfather, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right.\\r\\nYour sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.  You\\r\\nwould not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.\\r\\nAnne will send for me if anything is the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.\\r\\nMary knew, from Charles\\'s manner of speaking, that he was quite\\r\\ndetermined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.  She\\r\\nsaid nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as\\r\\nthere was only Anne to hear--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick\\r\\nchild; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!  I knew how\\r\\nit would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is anything\\r\\ndisagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles\\r\\nis as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say it is very\\r\\nunfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.  Talks of\\r\\nhis being going on so well!  How does he know that he is going on well,\\r\\nor that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?  I did not\\r\\nthink Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to go away\\r\\nand enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be\\r\\nallowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else\\r\\nto be about the child.  My being the mother is the very reason why my\\r\\nfeelings should not be tried.  I am not at all equal to it.  You saw\\r\\nhow hysterical I was yesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the\\r\\nshock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have\\r\\nnothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson\\'s\\r\\ndirections, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at\\r\\nyour husband.  Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his\\r\\nprovince.  A sick child is always the mother\\'s property:  her own\\r\\nfeelings generally make it so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that\\r\\nI am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot be\\r\\nalways scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw,\\r\\nthis morning, that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to begin\\r\\nkicking about.  I have not nerves for the sort of thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole\\r\\nevening away from the poor boy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so\\r\\ncareful; and she could send us word every hour how he was.  I really\\r\\nthink Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.  I\\r\\nam not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.  I was\\r\\ndreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\\r\\nsuppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles\\r\\nto my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain\\r\\nwith him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you serious?\" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  \"Dear me!  that\\'s\\r\\na very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure, I may just as well\\r\\ngo as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?  and it only harasses me.\\r\\nYou, who have not a mother\\'s feelings, are a great deal the properest\\r\\nperson.  You can make little Charles do anything; he always minds you\\r\\nat a word.  It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with\\r\\nJemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as\\r\\nmuch as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone.  An\\r\\nexcellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles,\\r\\nand get ready directly.  You can send for us, you know, at a moment\\'s\\r\\nnotice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing\\r\\nto alarm you.  I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel\\r\\nquite at ease about my dear child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next moment she was tapping at her husband\\'s dressing-room door,\\r\\nand as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for the whole\\r\\nconversation, which began with Mary\\'s saying, in a tone of great\\r\\nexultation--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home than\\r\\nyou are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should\\r\\nnot be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.  Anne will\\r\\nstay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.  It is\\r\\nAnne\\'s own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great\\r\\ndeal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is very kind of Anne,\" was her husband\\'s answer, \"and I should be\\r\\nvery glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be\\r\\nleft at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity of her\\r\\nmanner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction was at\\r\\nleast very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being left\\r\\nto dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\\r\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her to\\r\\nlet him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable; and this\\r\\nbeing the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off\\r\\ntogether in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped, to be happy,\\r\\nhowever oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself,\\r\\nshe was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever\\r\\nlikely to be hers.  She knew herself to be of the first utility to the\\r\\nchild; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a\\r\\nmile distant, making himself agreeable to others?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.  Perhaps\\r\\nindifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.  He\\r\\nmust be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished ever to see her\\r\\nagain, he need not have waited till this time; he would have done what\\r\\nshe could not but believe that in his place she should have done long\\r\\nago, when events had been early giving him the independence which alone\\r\\nhad been wanting.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,\\r\\nand their visit in general.  There had been music, singing, talking,\\r\\nlaughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain\\r\\nWentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other\\r\\nperfectly, and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with\\r\\nCharles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though\\r\\nthat had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed to come\\r\\nto the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs\\r\\nCharles Musgrove\\'s way, on account of the child, and therefore,\\r\\nsomehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles\\'s being to meet him\\r\\nto breakfast at his father\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired\\r\\nafter her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight\\r\\nacquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged,\\r\\nactuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they\\r\\nwere to meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the\\r\\nother house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary\\r\\nand Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to\\r\\nsay that they were just setting off, that he was come for his dogs,\\r\\nthat his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; his sisters\\r\\nmeaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposing\\r\\nalso to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though\\r\\nCharles had answered for the child\\'s being in no such state as could\\r\\nmake it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without\\r\\nhis running on to give notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive\\r\\nhim, while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was the\\r\\nmost consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.  In\\r\\ntwo minutes after Charles\\'s preparation, the others appeared; they were\\r\\nin the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth\\'s, a bow, a\\r\\ncurtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all that\\r\\nwas right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy\\r\\nfooting; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few\\r\\nminutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready,\\r\\ntheir visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too,\\r\\nsuddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the\\r\\nsportsmen:  the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her breakfast\\r\\nas she could.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again, in\\r\\nnervous gratitude.  \"The worst is over!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.  They had\\r\\nmet.  They had been once more in the same room.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling\\r\\nless.  Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been\\r\\ngiven up.  How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an\\r\\ninterval had banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not\\r\\neight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,\\r\\nremovals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\\r\\nhow natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part of her\\r\\nown life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\\r\\neight years may be little more than nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like wishing to\\r\\navoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly\\r\\nwhich asked the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have\\r\\nprevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss\\r\\nMusgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had\\r\\nthis spontaneous information from Mary:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was so\\r\\nattentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you, when they\\r\\nwent away, and he said, \\'You were so altered he should not have known\\r\\nyou again.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had no feelings to make her respect her sister\\'s in a common way,\\r\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar\\r\\nwound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Altered beyond his knowledge.\"  Anne fully submitted, in silent, deep\\r\\nmortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, for\\r\\nhe was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already acknowledged\\r\\nit to herself, and she could not think differently, let him think of\\r\\nher as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed her youth and\\r\\nbloom had only given him a more glowing, manly, open look, in no\\r\\nrespect lessening his personal advantages.  She had seen the same\\r\\nFrederick Wentworth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So altered that he should not have known her again!\"  These were words\\r\\nwhich could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice that\\r\\nshe had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency; they allayed\\r\\nagitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but\\r\\nwithout an idea that they would be carried round to her.  He had\\r\\nthought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had\\r\\nspoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.  She had used him\\r\\nill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse, she had shewn a\\r\\nfeebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident\\r\\ntemper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.  It\\r\\nhad been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been weakness and\\r\\ntimidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman\\r\\nsince whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural\\r\\nsensation of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her\\r\\npower with him was gone for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now his object to marry.  He was rich, and being turned on\\r\\nshore, fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly\\r\\ntempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the\\r\\nspeed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart\\r\\nfor either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in\\r\\nshort, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting Anne\\r\\nElliot.  This was his only secret exception, when he said to his\\r\\nsister, in answer to her suppositions:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.  Anybody\\r\\nbetween fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.  A little beauty,\\r\\nand a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost\\r\\nman.  Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society\\r\\namong women to make him nice?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye spoke\\r\\nthe conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of his\\r\\nthoughts, when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to\\r\\nmeet with.  \"A strong mind, with sweetness of manner,\" made the first\\r\\nand the last of the description.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the woman I want,\" said he.  \"Something a little inferior I\\r\\nshall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,\\r\\nI shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than\\r\\nmost men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the\\r\\nsame circle.  They were soon dining in company together at Mr\\r\\nMusgrove\\'s, for the little boy\\'s state could no longer supply his aunt\\r\\nwith a pretence for absenting herself; and this was but the beginning\\r\\nof other dinings and other meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the\\r\\nproof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of\\r\\neach; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement\\r\\ncould not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions\\r\\nwhich conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him, his\\r\\ndisposition lead him, to talk; and \"That was in the year six;\" \"That\\r\\nhappened before I went to sea in the year six,\" occurred in the course\\r\\nof the first evening they spent together: and though his voice did not\\r\\nfalter, and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering\\r\\ntowards her while he spoke, Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her\\r\\nknowledge of his mind, that he could be unvisited by remembrance any\\r\\nmore than herself.  There must be the same immediate association of\\r\\nthought, though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the\\r\\ncommonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!  Now nothing!\\r\\nThere had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the\\r\\ndrawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to\\r\\ncease to speak to one another.  With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral\\r\\nand Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne could\\r\\nallow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there could\\r\\nhave been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so\\r\\nin unison, no countenances so beloved.  Now they were as strangers;\\r\\nnay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted.  It\\r\\nwas a perpetual estrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.\\r\\nThere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the\\r\\nparty; and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss\\r\\nMusgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the\\r\\nmanner of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and\\r\\ntheir surprise at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation\\r\\nand arrangement which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant\\r\\nridicule, which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been\\r\\nignorant, and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be\\r\\nliving on board without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if\\r\\nthere were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper of Mrs\\r\\nMusgrove\\'s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare\\r\\nsay he would have been just such another by this time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove\\r\\nrelieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,\\r\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she could let her attention take its natural course again, she\\r\\nfound the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List (their own navy\\r\\nlist, the first that had ever been at Uppercross), and sitting down\\r\\ntogether to pore over it, with the professed view of finding out the\\r\\nships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up.  I was the\\r\\nlast man who commanded her.  Hardly fit for service then.  Reported fit\\r\\nfor home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the West\\r\\nIndies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls looked all amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then, with\\r\\nsending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.\\r\\nBut they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands that\\r\\nmay just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to\\r\\ndistinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" cried the Admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!\\r\\nNever was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built\\r\\nsloop, you would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows\\r\\nthere must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at\\r\\nthe same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no more\\r\\ninterest than his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;\" replied Captain Wentworth,\\r\\nseriously.  \"I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can\\r\\ndesire.  It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; a\\r\\nvery great object, I wanted to be doing something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore for\\r\\nhalf a year together?  If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be\\r\\nafloat again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Captain Wentworth,\" cried Louisa, \"how vexed you must have been\\r\\nwhen you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.\\r\\n\"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the\\r\\nfashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about\\r\\namong half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which\\r\\nat last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.  Ah! she was a dear\\r\\nold Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.  I knew she would.  I knew\\r\\nthat we should either go to the bottom together, or that she would be\\r\\nthe making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time\\r\\nI was at sea in her; and after taking privateers enough to be very\\r\\nentertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn,\\r\\nto fall in with the very French frigate I wanted.  I brought her into\\r\\nPlymouth; and here another instance of luck.  We had not been six hours\\r\\nin the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights,\\r\\nand which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch\\r\\nwith the Great Nation not having much improved our condition.\\r\\nFour-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of the\\r\\nnewspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought\\r\\nabout me.\" Anne\\'s shudderings were to herself alone; but the Miss\\r\\nMusgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations\\r\\nof pity and horror.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so then, I suppose,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice, as if\\r\\nthinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the Laconia, and there he met\\r\\nwith our poor boy. Charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her), \"do ask\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.  I\\r\\nalways forgot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at\\r\\nGibraltar, with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain\\r\\nWentworth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid of\\r\\nmentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to\\r\\nhear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\\r\\nonly nodded in reply, and walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could\\r\\nnot deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his\\r\\nown hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the little\\r\\nstatement of her name and rate, and present non-commissioned class,\\r\\nobserving over it that she too had been one of the best friends man\\r\\never had.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I made\\r\\nmoney in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together\\r\\noff the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!  You know how much he\\r\\nwanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.  Excellent fellow.  I\\r\\nshall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all, so much for her\\r\\nsake.  I wished for him again the next summer, when I had still the\\r\\nsame luck in the Mediterranean.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I am sure, Sir,\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\\r\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget what\\r\\nyou did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in\\r\\npart, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts,\\r\\nlooked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking of poor\\r\\nRichard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor dear fellow!\" continued Mrs Musgrove; \"he was grown so steady,\\r\\nand such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!  Ah!\\r\\nit would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.  I assure\\r\\nyou, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth\\'s face at this\\r\\nspeech, a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome\\r\\nmouth, which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove\\'s\\r\\nkind wishes, as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get\\r\\nrid of him; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to\\r\\nbe detected by any who understood him less than herself; in another\\r\\nmoment he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly\\r\\nafterwards coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were\\r\\nsitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with\\r\\nher, in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy and\\r\\nnatural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was\\r\\nreal and unabsurd in the parent\\'s feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily\\r\\nmade room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.  It was no\\r\\ninsignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable,\\r\\nsubstantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good\\r\\ncheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while the\\r\\nagitations of Anne\\'s slender form, and pensive face, may be considered\\r\\nas very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some\\r\\ncredit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat\\r\\nsighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary\\r\\nproportions.  A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep\\r\\naffliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair\\r\\nor not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will\\r\\npatronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will\\r\\nseize.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\r\\nwith his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife, now came\\r\\nup to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he might\\r\\nbe interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick, you\\r\\nwould have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her\\r\\ndaughters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;\\r\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on\\r\\nboard a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit, which a few\\r\\nhours might comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\\r\\ntowards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all\\r\\none\\'s efforts, and all one\\'s sacrifices, to make the accommodations on\\r\\nboard such as women ought to have.  There can be no want of gallantry,\\r\\nAdmiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high,\\r\\nand this is what I do.  I hate to hear of women on board, or to see\\r\\nthem on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family\\r\\nof ladies anywhere, if I can help it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis brought his sister upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Frederick!  But I cannot believe it of you.--All idle\\r\\nrefinement!--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house\\r\\nin England.  I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and\\r\\nI know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I\\r\\ndeclare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at\\r\\nKellynch Hall,\" (with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in\\r\\nmost of the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"You were living with\\r\\nyour husband, and were the only woman on board.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin, and\\r\\nthree children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this\\r\\nsuperfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any brother\\r\\nofficer\\'s wife that I could, and I would bring anything of Harville\\'s\\r\\nfrom the world\\'s end, if he wanted it.  But do not imagine that I did\\r\\nnot feel it an evil in itself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number of\\r\\nwomen and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would\\r\\nbecome of us poor sailors\\' wives, who often want to be conveyed to one\\r\\nport or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all\\r\\nher family to Plymouth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if\\r\\nwomen were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.  We none of\\r\\nus expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! my dear,\" said the Admiral, \"when he had got a wife, he will sing\\r\\na different tune.  When he is married, if we have the good luck to live\\r\\nto another war, we shall see him do as you and I, and a great many\\r\\nothers, have done.  We shall have him very thankful to anybody that\\r\\nwill bring him his wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, that we shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I have done,\" cried Captain Wentworth.  \"When once married people\\r\\nbegin to attack me with,--\\'Oh! you will think very differently, when\\r\\nyou are married.\\'  I can only say, \\'No, I shall not;\\' and then they say\\r\\nagain, \\'Yes, you will,\\' and there is an end of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up and moved away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a great traveller you must have been, ma\\'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove\\r\\nto Mrs Croft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pretty well, ma\\'am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many\\r\\nwomen have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have\\r\\nbeen once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides\\r\\nbeing in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.\\r\\nBut I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West\\r\\nIndies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse\\r\\nherself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I do assure you, ma\\'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can\\r\\nexceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the\\r\\nhigher rates.  When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more\\r\\nconfined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of\\r\\nthem; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been\\r\\nspent on board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was\\r\\nnothing to be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with\\r\\nexcellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little\\r\\ndisordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but\\r\\nnever knew what sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really\\r\\nsuffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself\\r\\nunwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by\\r\\nmyself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North\\r\\nSeas.  I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\\r\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I\\r\\nshould hear from him next; but as long as we could be together, nothing\\r\\never ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,\\r\\nMrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove\\'s hearty answer.  \"There is nothing so bad\\r\\nas a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is, for\\r\\nMr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are\\r\\nover, and he is safe back again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed, Anne offered\\r\\nher services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with\\r\\ntears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to be\\r\\nemployed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits than\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate him\\r\\nwhich general attention and deference, and especially the attention of\\r\\nall the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females of the\\r\\nfamily of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the\\r\\nhonour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, they\\r\\nboth seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but the continued\\r\\nappearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have\\r\\nmade it credible that they were not decided rivals.  If he were a\\r\\nlittle spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could\\r\\nwonder?\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers\\r\\nwere mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,\\r\\nequally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt that\\r\\nhe was looking at herself,  observing her altered features, perhaps,\\r\\ntrying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed\\r\\nhim; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was hardly\\r\\naware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was sure of his\\r\\nhaving asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?  The answer\\r\\nwas, \"Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.  She had rather\\r\\nplay.  She is never tired of playing.\"  Once, too, he spoke to her.\\r\\nShe had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he had sat\\r\\ndown to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss\\r\\nMusgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned to that part of the\\r\\nroom; he saw her, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she\\r\\nimmediately drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced\\r\\nto sit down again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.  His cold\\r\\npoliteness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long as\\r\\nhe liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral\\'s fraternal\\r\\nkindness as of his wife\\'s.  He had intended, on first arriving, to\\r\\nproceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in\\r\\nthat country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this\\r\\noff.  There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of\\r\\neverything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were so\\r\\nhospitable, the young so agreeable, that he could not but resolve to\\r\\nremain where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of\\r\\nEdward\\'s wife upon credit a little longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves could\\r\\nhardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly in the\\r\\nmorning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs\\r\\nCroft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in\\r\\ntheir new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about\\r\\nin a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,\\r\\nlately added to their establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the\\r\\nMusgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying, warm admiration\\r\\neverywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established,\\r\\nwhen a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal\\r\\ndisturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,\\r\\npleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a\\r\\nconsiderable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth\\'s\\r\\nintroduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the\\r\\nneighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father\\'s\\r\\nhouse, only two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home had\\r\\nleft his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\\r\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,\\r\\nand of seeing Captain Wentworth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money, but\\r\\ntheir marriages had made a material difference in their degree of\\r\\nconsequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it was\\r\\ninsignificant compared with Mr Musgrove\\'s; and while the Musgroves were\\r\\nin the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would,\\r\\nfrom their parents\\' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living,\\r\\nand their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at\\r\\nall, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course\\r\\nexcepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was\\r\\nvery superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no\\r\\npride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a\\r\\nconsciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them\\r\\npleased to improve their cousins.  Charles\\'s attentions to Henrietta\\r\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.\\r\\n\"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,\"--\\r\\nand Henrietta did seem to like him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but\\r\\nfrom that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet\\r\\nquite doubtful, as far as Anne\\'s observation reached.  Henrietta was\\r\\nperhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she knew not\\r\\nnow, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most\\r\\nlikely to attract him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire\\r\\nconfidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the\\r\\nyoung men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its\\r\\nchance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark\\r\\nabout them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage:\\r\\nthe young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss\\r\\nMusgroves\\' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when\\r\\nAnne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to\\r\\nwhich was the one liked best.  Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for\\r\\nHenrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be\\r\\nextremely delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he\\r\\nhad once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had\\r\\nnot made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.  Here was a\\r\\nfortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might\\r\\nbe done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as\\r\\nlikely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.  Oh! it\\r\\nwould be a capital match for either of his sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word it would,\" replied Mary.  \"Dear me!  If he should rise to\\r\\nany very great honours!  If he should ever be made a baronet!  \\'Lady\\r\\nWentworth\\' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing, indeed, for\\r\\nHenrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not\\r\\ndislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!  It would be but a new\\r\\ncreation, however, and I never think much of your new creations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very\\r\\naccount of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished to see put an\\r\\nend to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought\\r\\nit would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between\\r\\nthe families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for\\r\\nHenrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,\\r\\nshe has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman\\r\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\r\\nto the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to\\r\\nthose who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles\\r\\nHayter?  Nothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss\\r\\nMusgrove of Uppercross.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having\\r\\na regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw\\r\\nthings as an eldest son himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now you are talking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer.  \"It\\r\\nwould not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair\\r\\nchance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in\\r\\nthe course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he\\r\\nis the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty\\r\\nproperty.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and\\r\\nfifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best\\r\\nland in the country.  I grant you, that any of them but Charles would\\r\\nbe a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he\\r\\nis the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured,\\r\\ngood sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he\\r\\nwill make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different\\r\\nsort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible\\r\\nman--good, freehold property.  No, no; Henrietta might do worse than\\r\\nmarry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain\\r\\nWentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he\\r\\nwas out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry\\r\\nCharles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and\\r\\ntherefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon\\r\\nput him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he\\r\\nhas.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.  I wish\\r\\nyou had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to Captain Wentworth\\'s\\r\\nliking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he\\r\\ncertainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.  But Charles is so\\r\\npositive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might\\r\\nhave decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did,\\r\\nunless you had been determined to give it against me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA dinner at Mr Musgrove\\'s had been the occasion when all these things\\r\\nshould have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home, under the\\r\\nmixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indisposition\\r\\nin little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth;\\r\\nbut an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the\\r\\nadvantages of a quiet evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to Captain Wentworth\\'s views, she deemed it of more consequence that\\r\\nhe should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the\\r\\nhappiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour, than that he\\r\\nshould prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.  Either of\\r\\nthem would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured\\r\\nwife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must be\\r\\npained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a\\r\\nheart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if\\r\\nHenrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the\\r\\nalteration could not be understood too soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his\\r\\ncousin\\'s behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly\\r\\nestranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and\\r\\nleave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross:  but there\\r\\nwas such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain\\r\\nWentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause.  He had been absent\\r\\nonly two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, even\\r\\nto the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his\\r\\npresent curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then\\r\\nseemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who\\r\\nfor more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties\\r\\nof his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should\\r\\nbe quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as\\r\\ngood as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of\\r\\nit.  The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of\\r\\ngoing six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better\\r\\ncuracy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr\\r\\nShirley\\'s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get\\r\\nthrough without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to\\r\\nLouisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came\\r\\nback, alas!  the zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not\\r\\nlisten at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held\\r\\nwith Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain\\r\\nWentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to\\r\\ngive, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude\\r\\nof the negotiation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;\\r\\nI always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short, you\\r\\nknow, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.\\r\\nIs he coming, Louisa?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne\\r\\nhad not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at\\r\\nthe Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles,\\r\\nwho was lying on the sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived\\r\\nhis manners of their usual composure:  he started, and could only say,\\r\\n\"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me I\\r\\nshould find them here,\" before he walked to the window to recollect\\r\\nhimself, and feel how he ought to behave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few\\r\\nmoments, I dare say,\" had been Anne\\'s reply, in all the confusion that\\r\\nwas natural; and if the child had not called her to come and do\\r\\nsomething for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment,\\r\\nand released Captain Wentworth as well as herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, \"I\\r\\nhope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy\\r\\nher patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her very\\r\\ngreat satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the little\\r\\nvestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of the\\r\\nhouse; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters\\r\\neasy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight\\r\\nof Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of\\r\\nAnne.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe only attempted to say, \"How do you do?  Will you not sit down?  The\\r\\nothers will be here presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently not\\r\\nill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to\\r\\nhis attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the\\r\\nnewspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother minute brought another addition.  The younger boy, a remarkable\\r\\nstout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for\\r\\nhim by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, and\\r\\nwent straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his\\r\\nclaim to anything good that might be giving away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere being nothing to eat, he could only have some play; and as his\\r\\naunt would not let him tease his sick brother, he began to fasten\\r\\nhimself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was\\r\\nabout Charles, she could not shake him off.  She spoke to him, ordered,\\r\\nentreated, and insisted in vain.  Once she did contrive to push him\\r\\naway, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back\\r\\nagain directly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  You are extremely\\r\\ntroublesome.  I am very angry with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?  Do\\r\\nnot you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to cousin\\r\\nCharles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not a bit did Walter stir.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment, however, she found herself in the state of being\\r\\nreleased from him; some one was taking him from her, though he had bent\\r\\ndown her head so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastened\\r\\nfrom around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew\\r\\nthat Captain Wentworth had done it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.  She\\r\\ncould not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,\\r\\nwith most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward to her\\r\\nrelief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little\\r\\nparticulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on her\\r\\nby the noise he was studiously making with the child, that he meant to\\r\\navoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought to testify that her\\r\\nconversation was the last of his wants, produced such a confusion of\\r\\nvarying, but very painful agitation, as she could not recover from,\\r\\ntill enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make\\r\\nover her little patient to their cares, and leave the room.  She could\\r\\nnot stay.  It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and\\r\\njealousies of the four--they were now altogether; but she could stay\\r\\nfor none of it.  It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well\\r\\ninclined towards Captain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of his\\r\\nhaving said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth\\'s\\r\\ninterference, \"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to\\r\\nteaze your aunt;\" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain\\r\\nWentworth should do what he ought to have done himself.  But neither\\r\\nCharles Hayter\\'s feelings, nor anybody\\'s feelings, could interest her,\\r\\ntill she had a little better arranged her own.  She was ashamed of\\r\\nherself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a\\r\\ntrifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude\\r\\nand reflection to recover her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOther opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.\\r\\nAnne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\r\\nto have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,\\r\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; for\\r\\nwhile she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she could not\\r\\nbut think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory and\\r\\nexperience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.  They\\r\\nwere more in love with him; yet there it was not love.  It was a little\\r\\nfever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with\\r\\nsome.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henrietta\\r\\nhad sometimes the air of being divided between them.  Anne longed for\\r\\nthe power of representing to them all what they were about, and of\\r\\npointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.  She\\r\\ndid not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction to her\\r\\nto believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was\\r\\noccasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his manner.\\r\\nHe had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of\\r\\nCharles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting the attentions (for\\r\\naccepting must be the word) of two young women at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the\\r\\nfield.  Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross; a\\r\\nmost decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation to\\r\\ndinner; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some\\r\\nlarge books before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be\\r\\nright, and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.\\r\\nIt was Mary\\'s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\r\\nfrom Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence of\\r\\nseeing him to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was\\r\\nwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth\\r\\nbeing gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage were\\r\\nsitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters\\r\\nfrom the Mansion-house.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came through\\r\\nthe little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that\\r\\nthey were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Mary could\\r\\nnot like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with some\\r\\njealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes, I should like\\r\\nto join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\" Anne felt\\r\\npersuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what\\r\\nthey did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the\\r\\nfamily habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be\\r\\ncommunicated, and everything being to be done together, however\\r\\nundesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but\\r\\nin vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss\\r\\nMusgroves\\' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as\\r\\nshe might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening the\\r\\ninterference in any plan of their own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long\\r\\nwalk,\" said Mary, as she went up stairs.  \"Everybody is always\\r\\nsupposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been\\r\\npleased, if we had refused to join them.  When people come in this\\r\\nmanner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken\\r\\nout a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.\\r\\nTheir time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\\r\\nfor this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne have\\r\\nforeseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but, from some\\r\\nfeelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was too\\r\\nlate to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the\\r\\ndirection chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the\\r\\nwalk as under their guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne\\'s object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the\\r\\nnarrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep\\r\\nwith her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk must arise from\\r\\nthe exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year\\r\\nupon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to\\r\\nherself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of\\r\\nautumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind\\r\\nof taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet,\\r\\nworthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of\\r\\nfeeling.  She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like\\r\\nmusings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\\r\\nof Captain Wentworth\\'s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,\\r\\nshe should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\\r\\nIt was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate\\r\\nfooting, might fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with\\r\\nHenrietta.  Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her\\r\\nsister.  This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one\\r\\nspeech of Louisa\\'s which struck her.  After one of the many praises of\\r\\nthe day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth\\r\\nadded:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to\\r\\ntake a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of\\r\\nthese hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.  I\\r\\nwonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen very\\r\\noften, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would as\\r\\nlieve be tossed out as not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! You make the most of it, I know,\" cried Louisa, \"but if it were\\r\\nreally so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,\\r\\nas she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should\\r\\never separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven\\r\\nsafely by anybody else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was spoken with enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\" And there\\r\\nwas silence between them for a little while.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet\\r\\nscenes of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,\\r\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\\r\\nhappiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone\\r\\ntogether, blessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they\\r\\nstruck by order into another path, \"Is not this one of the ways to\\r\\nWinthrop?\" But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes to be\\r\\nmet with, strolling about near home--was their destination; and after\\r\\nanother half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the\\r\\nploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting\\r\\nthe sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring again,\\r\\nthey gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which parted\\r\\nUppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the latter,\\r\\nat the foot of the hill on the other side.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them;\\r\\nan indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and\\r\\nbuildings of a farm-yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary exclaimed, \"Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!\\r\\nWell now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHenrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles walking\\r\\nalong any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready to do as Mary\\r\\nwished; but \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and \"No, no!\" cried Louisa\\r\\nmore eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be arguing the\\r\\nmatter warmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\r\\nof calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\\r\\nthough more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.  But this\\r\\nwas one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength; and when\\r\\nhe recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at\\r\\nWinthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered, \"Oh! no,\\r\\nindeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any\\r\\nsitting down could do her good;\" and, in short, her look and manner\\r\\ndeclared, that go she would not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\\r\\nit was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he and\\r\\nHenrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt and\\r\\ncousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the\\r\\nhill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as she\\r\\nwent a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta,\\r\\nMary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her, and saying\\r\\nto Captain Wentworth--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you, I\\r\\nhave never been in the house above twice in my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,\\r\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne\\r\\nperfectly knew the meaning of.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot: Louisa\\r\\nreturned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step\\r\\nof a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood\\r\\nabout her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for a\\r\\ngleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone by\\r\\ndegrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; she\\r\\nquarrelled with her own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much better\\r\\nsomewhere, and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a\\r\\nbetter also.  She turned through the same gate, but could not see them.\\r\\nAnne found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the\\r\\nhedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot\\r\\nor other.  Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was\\r\\nsure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on\\r\\ntill she overtook her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon\\r\\nheard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if\\r\\nmaking their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\\r\\ncentre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa\\'s voice was the\\r\\nfirst distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some eager\\r\\nspeech.  What Anne first heard was--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened\\r\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from\\r\\ndoing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,\\r\\nby the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may\\r\\nsay?  No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have\\r\\nmade up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have\\r\\nmade up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near\\r\\ngiving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She would have turned back then, but for you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints\\r\\nyou gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last\\r\\ntime I was in company with him,  I need not affect to have no\\r\\ncomprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than a mere dutiful\\r\\nmorning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him, and her\\r\\ntoo, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in\\r\\ncircumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she have not\\r\\nresolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this.\\r\\nYour sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of\\r\\ndecision and firmness, I see.  If you value her conduct or happiness,\\r\\ninfuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no\\r\\ndoubt, you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too\\r\\nyielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be\\r\\ndepended on.  You are never sure of a good impression being durable;\\r\\neverybody may sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is\\r\\na nut,\" said he, catching one down from an upper bough, \"to exemplify:\\r\\na beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has\\r\\noutlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not a weak spot\\r\\nanywhere.  This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity, \"while so\\r\\nmany of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still\\r\\nin possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed\\r\\ncapable of.\"  Then returning to his former earnest tone--\"My first\\r\\nwish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.  If\\r\\nLouisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,\\r\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if\\r\\nLouisa could have readily answered such a speech:  words of such\\r\\ninterest, spoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what\\r\\nLouisa was feeling.  For herself, she feared to move, lest she should\\r\\nbe seen.  While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected\\r\\nher, and they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,\\r\\nhowever, Louisa spoke again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she; \"but she does\\r\\nsometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride--the Elliot\\r\\npride.  She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.  We do so\\r\\nwish that Charles had married Anne instead.  I suppose you know he\\r\\nwanted to marry Anne?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause, Captain Wentworth said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you mean that she refused him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes; certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When did that happen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;\\r\\nbut I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had\\r\\naccepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better; and\\r\\npapa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell\\'s\\r\\ndoing, that she did not.  They think Charles might not be learned and\\r\\nbookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she\\r\\npersuaded Anne to refuse him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.  Her own\\r\\nemotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from, before\\r\\nshe could move.  The listener\\'s proverbial fate was not absolutely\\r\\nhers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard a great deal\\r\\nof very painful import.  She saw how her own character was considered\\r\\nby Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling\\r\\nand curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme\\r\\nagitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found, and walked\\r\\nback with her to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort\\r\\nin their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once\\r\\nmore in motion together.  Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence\\r\\nwhich only numbers could give.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\\r\\nCharles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne could not\\r\\nattempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to\\r\\nperfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on the\\r\\ngentleman\\'s side, and a relenting on the lady\\'s, and that they were now\\r\\nvery glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.  Henrietta\\r\\nlooked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charles Hayter\\r\\nexceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other almost from the\\r\\nfirst instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could\\r\\nbe plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they\\r\\nwere not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two.  In\\r\\na long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they\\r\\nwere thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of\\r\\nthe three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anne\\r\\nnecessarily belonged.  She joined Charles and Mary, and was tired\\r\\nenough to be very glad of Charles\\'s other arm; but Charles, though in\\r\\nvery good humour with her, was out of temper with his wife.  Mary had\\r\\nshewn herself disobliging to him, and was now to reap the consequence,\\r\\nwhich consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut\\r\\noff the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when\\r\\nMary began to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according\\r\\nto custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded\\r\\non the other, he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which\\r\\nhe had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of\\r\\nit was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\\r\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time\\r\\nheard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft\\'s gig.  He\\r\\nand his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\\r\\nUpon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they\\r\\nkindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it\\r\\nwould save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.\\r\\nThe invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves\\r\\nwere not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked\\r\\nbefore any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could\\r\\nnot endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\\r\\nopposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\\r\\nwhen Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\r\\nto his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,\" cried Mrs Croft.  \"Do let us\\r\\nhave the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room for\\r\\nthree, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might sit\\r\\nfour.  You must, indeed, you must.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to\\r\\ndecline, she was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral\\'s kind urgency\\r\\ncame in support of his wife\\'s; they would not be refused; they\\r\\ncompressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a\\r\\ncorner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her,\\r\\nand quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had\\r\\nplaced her there, that his will and his hands had done it, that she\\r\\nowed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution to give\\r\\nher rest.  She was very much affected by the view of his disposition\\r\\ntowards her, which all these things made apparent.  This little\\r\\ncircumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.  She\\r\\nunderstood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not be\\r\\nunfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with\\r\\nhigh and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and\\r\\nthough becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\\r\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder of former\\r\\nsentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship;\\r\\nit was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could not\\r\\ncontemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that\\r\\nshe knew not which prevailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at\\r\\nfirst unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way along the\\r\\nrough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.  She then\\r\\nfound them talking of \"Frederick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,\"\\r\\nsaid the Admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  He has been running\\r\\nafter them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\\r\\nAy, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have settled\\r\\nit long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long\\r\\ncourtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear, between the\\r\\nfirst time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our\\r\\nlodgings at North Yarmouth?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft,\\r\\npleasantly; \"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an\\r\\nunderstanding, she would never be persuaded that we could be happy\\r\\ntogether.  I had known you by character, however, long before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\\r\\nto wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.\\r\\nI wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\\r\\none of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always be\\r\\ncompany for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly\\r\\nknow one from the other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said Mrs Croft, in a\\r\\ntone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers\\r\\nmight not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother; \"and\\r\\na very respectable family.  One could not be connected with better\\r\\npeople.  My dear Admiral, that post!  we shall certainly take that\\r\\npost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\r\\npassed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her\\r\\nhand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; and\\r\\nAnne, with some amusement at their style of driving, which she imagined\\r\\nno bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, found\\r\\nherself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time now approached for Lady Russell\\'s return:  the day was even\\r\\nfixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was\\r\\nresettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and\\r\\nbeginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within\\r\\nhalf a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and\\r\\nthere must be intercourse between the two families.  This was against\\r\\nher; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross,\\r\\nthat in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him\\r\\nbehind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed\\r\\nshe must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as\\r\\ncertainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary\\r\\nfor Lady Russell.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain\\r\\nWentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed former meetings which\\r\\nwould be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxious\\r\\nfor the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting\\r\\nanywhere.  They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance\\r\\nnow could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she\\r\\nmight think that he had too much self-possession, and she too little.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal\\r\\nfrom Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed quite long\\r\\nenough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some\\r\\nsweetness to the memory of her two months\\' visit there, but he was\\r\\ngaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way which\\r\\nshe had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and\\r\\nunheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them\\r\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.\\r\\n\\r\\nA letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at\\r\\nlast, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville\\'s being settled with\\r\\nhis family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite\\r\\nunknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville had\\r\\nnever been in good health since a severe wound which he received two\\r\\nyears before, and Captain Wentworth\\'s anxiety to see him had determined\\r\\nhim to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there for four-and-twenty\\r\\nhours.  His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honoured, a\\r\\nlively interest excited for his friend, and his description of the fine\\r\\ncountry about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an\\r\\nearnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither\\r\\nwas the consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked\\r\\nof going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from\\r\\nUppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in\\r\\nshort, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the\\r\\nresolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, being\\r\\nnow armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore down\\r\\nall the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer;\\r\\nand to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa,\\r\\nand Captain Wentworth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at\\r\\nnight; but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not\\r\\nconsent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the\\r\\nmiddle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,\\r\\nafter deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for\\r\\ngoing and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,\\r\\nand not to be expected back till the next day\\'s dinner.  This was felt\\r\\nto be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great\\r\\nHouse at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,\\r\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove\\'s coach\\r\\ncontaining the four ladies, and Charles\\'s curricle, in which he drove\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and\\r\\nentering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was\\r\\nvery evident they would not have more than time for looking about them,\\r\\nbefore the light and warmth of the day were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the\\r\\ninns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\r\\ndown to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusement\\r\\nor variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms were\\r\\nshut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the\\r\\nresidents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings\\r\\nthemselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street\\r\\nalmost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round\\r\\nthe pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing\\r\\nmachines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new\\r\\nimprovements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to\\r\\nthe east of the town, are what the stranger\\'s eye will seek; and a very\\r\\nstrange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate\\r\\nenvirons of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.  The scenes in\\r\\nits neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive\\r\\nsweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by\\r\\ndark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the\\r\\nhappiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in\\r\\nunwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of\\r\\nUp Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic\\r\\nrocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant\\r\\ngrowth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the\\r\\nfirst partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a\\r\\nstate, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may\\r\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of\\r\\nWight:  these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the\\r\\nworth of Lyme understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and\\r\\nmelancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves\\r\\non the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on a\\r\\nfirst return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,\\r\\nproceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and on\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s account:  for in a small house, near the foot of an\\r\\nold pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.  Captain\\r\\nWentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on, and he\\r\\nwas to join them on the Cobb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even\\r\\nLouisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,\\r\\nwhen they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all well\\r\\nknown already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and a\\r\\nCaptain Benwick, who was staying with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;\\r\\nand the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him, on his return\\r\\nfrom Lyme before, his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and\\r\\nan officer, whom he had always valued highly, which must have stamped\\r\\nhim well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a little\\r\\nhistory of his private life, which rendered him perfectly interesting\\r\\nin the eyes of all the ladies.  He had been engaged to Captain\\r\\nHarville\\'s sister, and was now mourning her loss.  They had been a year\\r\\nor two waiting for fortune and promotion.  Fortune came, his\\r\\nprize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last;\\r\\nbut Fanny Harville did not live to know it.  She had died the preceding\\r\\nsummer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth believed it impossible\\r\\nfor man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to\\r\\nFanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful\\r\\nchange.  He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer\\r\\nheavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring\\r\\nmanners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits.  To\\r\\nfinish the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the\\r\\nHarvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all\\r\\ntheir views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them\\r\\nentirely.  Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a\\r\\nyear; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to\\r\\na residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the\\r\\ncountry, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly\\r\\nadapted to Captain Benwick\\'s state of mind.  The sympathy and good-will\\r\\nexcited towards Captain Benwick was very great.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the\\r\\nparty, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have.  I\\r\\ncannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.  He is younger than\\r\\nI am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man.  He will\\r\\nrally again, and be happy with another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall, dark\\r\\nman, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from\\r\\nstrong features and want of health, looking much older than Captain\\r\\nWentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three,\\r\\nand, compared with either of them, a little man.  He had a pleasing\\r\\nface and a melancholy air, just as he ought to have, and drew back from\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,\\r\\nwas a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.  Mrs Harville,\\r\\na degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have the\\r\\nsame good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their\\r\\ndesire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because\\r\\nthe friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their\\r\\nentreaties for their all promising to dine with them.  The dinner,\\r\\nalready ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted\\r\\nas a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should\\r\\nhave brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing\\r\\nof course that they should dine with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such\\r\\na bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike\\r\\nthe usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality\\r\\nand display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by\\r\\nan increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.  \"These would\\r\\nhave been all my friends,\" was her thought; and she had to struggle\\r\\nagainst a great tendency to lowness.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\\r\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\r\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had a moment\\'s\\r\\nastonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost in the\\r\\npleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious\\r\\ncontrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn the\\r\\nactual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies of\\r\\nlodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors against the\\r\\nwinter storms to be expected.  The varieties in the fitting-up of the\\r\\nrooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the\\r\\ncommon indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a\\r\\nrare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious\\r\\nand valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had\\r\\nvisited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with\\r\\nhis profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence\\r\\non his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it\\r\\npresented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived excellent\\r\\naccommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable\\r\\ncollection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick.  His\\r\\nlameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind of\\r\\nusefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment\\r\\nwithin.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toys\\r\\nfor the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with\\r\\nimprovements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his large\\r\\nfishing-net at one corner of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the\\r\\nhouse; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst forth into\\r\\nraptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their\\r\\nfriendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness;\\r\\nprotesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and\\r\\nwarmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to\\r\\nlive, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme answered\\r\\nalready, that nothing was found amiss; though its being \"so entirely\\r\\nout of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of Lyme,\" and the \"no\\r\\nexpectation of company,\" had brought many apologies from the heads of\\r\\nthe inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being\\r\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s company than she had at first imagined could\\r\\never be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now, and the\\r\\ninterchange of the common civilities attending on it (they never got\\r\\nbeyond), was become a mere nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,\\r\\nbut Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and he\\r\\ncame, bringing his friend also, which was more than had been expected,\\r\\nit having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of\\r\\nbeing oppressed by the presence of so many strangers.  He ventured\\r\\namong them again, however, though his spirits certainly did not seem\\r\\nfit for the mirth of the party in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the\\r\\nroom, and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance\\r\\nto occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne\\'s lot to be placed\\r\\nrather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of her\\r\\nnature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.  He was shy, and\\r\\ndisposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her countenance,\\r\\nand gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was well\\r\\nrepaid the first trouble of exertion.  He was evidently a young man of\\r\\nconsiderable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; and\\r\\nbesides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening\\'s\\r\\nindulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his usual companions\\r\\nhad probably no concern in, she had the hope of being of real use to\\r\\nhim in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling\\r\\nagainst affliction, which had naturally grown out of their\\r\\nconversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; it had rather\\r\\nthe appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and\\r\\nhaving talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gone\\r\\nthrough a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets,\\r\\ntrying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be\\r\\npreferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and\\r\\nmoreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, he showed himself so\\r\\nintimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and\\r\\nall the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; he\\r\\nrepeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a\\r\\nbroken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked so\\r\\nentirely as if he meant to be understood, that she ventured to hope he\\r\\ndid not always read only poetry, and to say, that she thought it was\\r\\nthe misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who\\r\\nenjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could\\r\\nestimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but\\r\\nsparingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion to his\\r\\nsituation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself the\\r\\nright of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend a larger\\r\\nallowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested to\\r\\nparticularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, such\\r\\ncollections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters of worth\\r\\nand suffering, as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse\\r\\nand fortify the mind by the highest precepts, and the strongest\\r\\nexamples of moral and religious endurances.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for the\\r\\ninterest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs which\\r\\ndeclared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like\\r\\nhis, noted down the names of those she recommended, and promised to\\r\\nprocure and read them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea of\\r\\nher coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\r\\nwhom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing, on more\\r\\nserious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and\\r\\npreachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\r\\nwould ill bear examination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party the\\r\\nnext morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.  They\\r\\nwent to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide, which a fine\\r\\nsouth-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so\\r\\nflat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning; gloried in the sea;\\r\\nsympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze--and were\\r\\nsilent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the\\r\\nsea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been of\\r\\nthe greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last spring\\r\\ntwelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month,\\r\\ndid him more good than all the medicine he took; and, that being by the\\r\\nsea, always makes him feel young again.  Now, I cannot help thinking it\\r\\na pity that he does not live entirely by the sea.  I do think he had\\r\\nbetter leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne?\\r\\nDo not you agree with me, that it is the best thing he could do, both\\r\\nfor himself and Mrs Shirley?  She has cousins here, you know, and many\\r\\nacquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she\\r\\nwould be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance\\r\\nat hand, in case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it\\r\\nquite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley,\\r\\nwho have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days\\r\\nin a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut\\r\\nout from all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.  I\\r\\nreally think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation, there\\r\\ncould be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.  My\\r\\nonly doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.\\r\\nHe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous I\\r\\nmust say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?  Do not\\r\\nyou think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman\\r\\nsacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well\\r\\nperformed by another person?  And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles\\r\\noff, he would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was\\r\\nanything to complain of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and entered\\r\\ninto the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of\\r\\na young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lower\\r\\nstandard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?  She said\\r\\nall that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims of\\r\\nDr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very desirable it was that\\r\\nhe should have some active, respectable young man, as a resident\\r\\ncurate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such\\r\\nresident curate\\'s being married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish,\" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion, \"I wish\\r\\nLady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley.  I\\r\\nhave always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence\\r\\nwith everybody!  I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to\\r\\nanything!  I am afraid of her, as I have told you before, quite afraid\\r\\nof her, because she is so very clever; but I respect her amazingly, and\\r\\nwish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was amused by Henrietta\\'s manner of being grateful, and amused\\r\\nalso that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta\\'s\\r\\nviews should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the\\r\\nMusgrove family; she had only time, however, for a general answer, and\\r\\na wish that such another woman were at Uppercross, before all subjects\\r\\nsuddenly ceased, on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards\\r\\nthem.  They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be\\r\\nready; but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had\\r\\nsomething to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her\\r\\ninto the town.  They were all at her disposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a\\r\\ngentleman, at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew\\r\\nback, and stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him; and\\r\\nas they passed, Anne\\'s face caught his eye, and he looked at her with a\\r\\ndegree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.\\r\\nShe was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty\\r\\nfeatures, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine\\r\\nwind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of\\r\\neye which it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,\\r\\n(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.  Captain\\r\\nWentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his\\r\\nnoticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of\\r\\nbrightness, which seemed to say, \"That man is struck with you, and even\\r\\nI, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about a\\r\\nlittle longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing\\r\\nafterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had\\r\\nnearly run against the very same gentleman, as he came out of an\\r\\nadjoining apartment.  She had before conjectured him to be a stranger\\r\\nlike themselves, and determined that a well-looking groom, who was\\r\\nstrolling about near the two inns as they came back, should be his\\r\\nservant.  Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.  It\\r\\nwas now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves; and this\\r\\nsecond meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman\\'s\\r\\nlooks, that he thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and\\r\\npropriety of his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly good\\r\\nmanners.  He seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an\\r\\nagreeable person.  Anne felt that she should like to know who he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, (almost\\r\\nthe first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party to\\r\\nthe window.  It was a gentleman\\'s carriage, a curricle, but only coming\\r\\nround from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be going\\r\\naway.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare\\r\\nit with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne\\'s curiosity, and\\r\\nthe whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner of the\\r\\ncurricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and\\r\\ncivilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at\\r\\nAnne, \"it is the very man we passed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him as\\r\\nfar up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.\\r\\nThe waiter came into the room soon afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray,\" said Captain Wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name\\r\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last\\r\\nnight from Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you\\r\\nwere at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath and\\r\\nLondon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elliot!\"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the\\r\\nname, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity\\r\\nof a waiter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless me!\" cried Mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr\\r\\nElliot, it must, indeed!  Charles, Anne, must not it?  In mourning, you\\r\\nsee, just as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!  In the\\r\\nvery same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?  my\\r\\nfather\\'s next heir?  Pray sir,\" turning to the waiter, \"did not you\\r\\nhear, did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch\\r\\nfamily?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said his\\r\\nmaster was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There! you see!\" cried Mary in an ecstasy, \"just as I said!  Heir to\\r\\nSir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out, if it was so.\\r\\nDepend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants take care to\\r\\npublish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary!\\r\\nI wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had been aware in time, who\\r\\nit was, that he might have been introduced to us.  What a pity that we\\r\\nshould not have been introduced to each other!  Do you think he had the\\r\\nElliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him, I was looking at the\\r\\nhorses; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance, I\\r\\nwonder the arms did not strike me!  Oh! the great-coat was hanging over\\r\\nthe panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should\\r\\nhave observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in\\r\\nmourning, one should have known him by the livery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\" said\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement of\\r\\nProvidence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she could command Mary\\'s attention, Anne quietly tried to convince\\r\\nher that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years, been on\\r\\nsuch terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all\\r\\ndesirable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself to\\r\\nhave seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was\\r\\nundoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.  She would not,\\r\\nupon any account, mention her having met with him the second time;\\r\\nluckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in\\r\\ntheir earlier walk, but she would have felt quite ill-used by Anne\\'s\\r\\nhaving actually run against him in the passage, and received his very\\r\\npolite excuses, while she had never been near him at all; no, that\\r\\ncousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" said Mary, \"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot, the\\r\\nnext time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly ought to hear\\r\\nof it; do mention all about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which she\\r\\nconsidered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as what\\r\\nought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given her father,\\r\\nmany years back, she knew; Elizabeth\\'s particular share in it she\\r\\nsuspected; and that Mr Elliot\\'s idea always produced irritation in both\\r\\nwas beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil of\\r\\nkeeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell\\r\\non Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain and\\r\\nMrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed to take\\r\\ntheir last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off for\\r\\nUppercross by one, and in the meanwhile were to be all together, and\\r\\nout of doors as long as they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all\\r\\nfairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening did not\\r\\ndisincline him to seek her again; and they walked together some time,\\r\\ntalking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron, and still as unable as\\r\\nbefore, and as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alike\\r\\nof the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost general\\r\\nchange amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she had\\r\\nCaptain Harville by her side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed\\r\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have such\\r\\ncompany oftener.  It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is;\\r\\nbut what can we do?  We cannot part.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in\\r\\ntime, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction, and\\r\\nyou must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called\\r\\na young mourner--only last summer, I understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only June.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,\\r\\njust made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of\\r\\nhim; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for\\r\\nPortsmouth.  There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it?\\r\\nnot I.  I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could\\r\\ndo it, but that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  \"The\\r\\nLaconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her being\\r\\nsent to sea again.  He stood his chance for the rest; wrote up for\\r\\nleave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and\\r\\nday till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant,\\r\\nand never left the poor fellow for a week.  That\\'s what he did, and\\r\\nnobody else could have saved poor James.  You may think, Miss Elliot,\\r\\nwhether he is dear to us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\\r\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed able to\\r\\nbear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject, and when he\\r\\nspoke again, it was of something totally different.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Harville\\'s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\r\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the\\r\\ndirection of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they\\r\\nwould accompany them to their door, and then return and set off\\r\\nthemselves.  By all their calculations there was just time for this;\\r\\nbut as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk\\r\\nalong it once more, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so\\r\\ndetermined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\\r\\nwould be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking, and\\r\\nall the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be\\r\\nimagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door,\\r\\nand still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them\\r\\nto the last, proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron\\'s \"dark\\r\\nblue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by their present\\r\\nview, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention\\r\\nwas possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant\\r\\nfor the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and\\r\\nall were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\\r\\nexcepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.\\r\\nIn all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles; the\\r\\nsensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement for her\\r\\nfeet, made him less willing upon the present occasion; he did it,\\r\\nhowever.  She was safely down, and instantly, to show her enjoyment,\\r\\nran up the steps to be jumped down again.  He advised her against it,\\r\\nthought the jar too great; but no, he reasoned and talked in vain, she\\r\\nsmiled and said, \"I am determined I will:\" he put out his hands; she\\r\\nwas too precipitate by half a second, she fell on the pavement on the\\r\\nLower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!  There was no wound, no blood,\\r\\nno visible bruise; but her eyes were closed, she breathed not, her face\\r\\nwas like death.  The horror of the moment to all who stood around!\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\\r\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of\\r\\nsilence.  \"She is dead! she is dead!\" screamed Mary, catching hold of\\r\\nher husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him\\r\\nimmoveable; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the\\r\\nconviction, lost her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps,\\r\\nbut for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which burst from\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if all his own strength\\r\\nwere gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven\\'s sake go to him.  I\\r\\ncan support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands, rub\\r\\nher temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment, disengaging\\r\\nhimself from his wife, they were both with him; and Louisa was raised\\r\\nup and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done that\\r\\nAnne had prompted, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggering\\r\\nagainst the wall for his support, exclaimed in the bitterest agony--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh God! her father and mother!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A surgeon!\" said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--\\r\\n\"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away, when Anne\\r\\neagerly suggested--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?  He knows\\r\\nwhere a surgeon is to be found.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in a\\r\\nmoment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had resigned\\r\\nthe poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother\\'s care, and was\\r\\noff for the town with the utmost rapidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which\\r\\nof the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: Captain\\r\\nWentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate brother,\\r\\nhung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes from\\r\\none sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witness\\r\\nthe hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him for help which he\\r\\ncould not give.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought, which\\r\\ninstinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals, to suggest\\r\\ncomfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles, to\\r\\nassuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her\\r\\nfor directions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?  What, in\\r\\nheaven\\'s name, is to be done next?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s eyes were also turned towards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure: carry her\\r\\ngently to the inn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively\\r\\ncollected, and eager to be doing something.  \"I will carry her myself.\\r\\nMusgrove, take care of the others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\r\\nand boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them, to be\\r\\nuseful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady,\\r\\nnay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the first\\r\\nreport.  To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta was\\r\\nconsigned, for, though partially revived, she was quite helpless; and\\r\\nin this manner, Anne walking by her side, and Charles attending to his\\r\\nwife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the\\r\\nground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they\\r\\nhad passed along.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.  Captain\\r\\nBenwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance which\\r\\nshowed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\\r\\ninformed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.  Shocked as\\r\\nCaptain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be\\r\\ninstantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was\\r\\nto be done.  She must be taken to their house; all must go to their\\r\\nhouse; and await the surgeon\\'s arrival there.  They would not listen to\\r\\nscruples:  he was obeyed; they were all beneath his roof; and while\\r\\nLouisa, under Mrs Harville\\'s direction, was conveyed up stairs, and\\r\\ngiven possession of her own bed, assistance, cordials, restoratives\\r\\nwere supplied by her husband to all who needed them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again, without\\r\\napparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life, however, of\\r\\nservice to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly incapable of\\r\\nbeing in the same room with Louisa, was kept, by the agitation of hope\\r\\nand fear, from a return of her own insensibility.  Mary, too, was\\r\\ngrowing calmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.  They\\r\\nwere sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.  The\\r\\nhead had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\\r\\nrecovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say a\\r\\nfew hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and\\r\\nthe ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a\\r\\nfew fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, may\\r\\nbe conceived.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered by Captain\\r\\nWentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight\\r\\nof him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded\\r\\narms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of\\r\\nhis soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa\\'s limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be\\r\\ndone, as to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to\\r\\neach other and consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, however\\r\\ndistressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such\\r\\ntrouble, did not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  The\\r\\nHarvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all\\r\\ngratitude.  They had looked forward and arranged everything before the\\r\\nothers began to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to\\r\\nthem, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.  They\\r\\nwere only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yet\\r\\nperhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid\\'s room, or swinging\\r\\na cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not finding room\\r\\nfor two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though,\\r\\nwith regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be the\\r\\nleast uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville\\'s care entirely.  Mrs\\r\\nHarville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid, who had\\r\\nlived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere, was just such\\r\\nanother.  Between these two, she could want no possible attendance by\\r\\nday or night.  And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of\\r\\nfeeling irresistible.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in\\r\\nconsultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of\\r\\nperplexity and terror.  \"Uppercross, the necessity of some one\\'s going\\r\\nto Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr\\r\\nand Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone\\r\\nsince they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in\\r\\ntolerable time.\" At first, they were capable of nothing more to the\\r\\npurpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,\\r\\nexerting himself, said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.  Every\\r\\nminute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross\\r\\ninstantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.  He\\r\\nwould be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;\\r\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor\\r\\nwould.  So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the\\r\\nsame.  She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The\\r\\nusefulness of her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in\\r\\nLouisa\\'s room, or to look at her, without sufferings which made her\\r\\nworse than helpless!  She was forced to acknowledge that she could do\\r\\nno good, yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the\\r\\nthought of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented, she\\r\\nwas anxious to be at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly down from\\r\\nLouisa\\'s room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour door\\r\\nwas open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth, \"that you\\r\\nstay, and that I take care of your sister home.  But as to the rest, as\\r\\nto the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be\\r\\nonly one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to\\r\\nher children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as\\r\\nAnne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so\\r\\nspoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said, and she then\\r\\nappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\\r\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which\\r\\nseemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply, and he\\r\\nrecollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself most\\r\\nwilling, ready, happy to remain.  \"It was what she had been thinking\\r\\nof, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor in Louisa\\'s\\r\\nroom would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather\\r\\ndesirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\r\\nshare of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take\\r\\nthem back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain\\r\\nWentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be much\\r\\nbetter for him to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove\\'s\\r\\ncarriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there\\r\\nwould be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa\\'s night.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\\r\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was made\\r\\nknown to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.  She was\\r\\nso wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in being\\r\\nexpected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa,\\r\\nwhile she was her sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrietta\\'s\\r\\nstead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?  And to go home\\r\\nwithout Charles, too, without her husband!  No, it was too unkind.  And\\r\\nin short, she said more than her husband could long withstand, and as\\r\\nnone of the others could oppose when he gave way, there was no help for\\r\\nit; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and\\r\\nill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for the\\r\\ntown, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attending\\r\\nto her.  She gave a moment\\'s recollection, as they hurried along, to\\r\\nthe little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in\\r\\nthe morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta\\'s schemes for Dr\\r\\nShirley\\'s leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr Elliot;\\r\\na moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, or\\r\\nthose who were wrapt up in her welfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and, united as\\r\\nthey all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt an increasing\\r\\ndegree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even in thinking that\\r\\nit might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in\\r\\nwaiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the\\r\\nstreet; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of\\r\\none sister for the other, the change in his countenance, the\\r\\nastonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles\\r\\nwas listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at\\r\\nleast convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to\\r\\nLouisa.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating the\\r\\nfeelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have attended on\\r\\nLouisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; and\\r\\nshe hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink\\r\\nunnecessarily from the office of a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meanwhile she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,\\r\\nand placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\\r\\ncircumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted\\r\\nLyme.  How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their\\r\\nmanners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not\\r\\nforesee.  It was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to\\r\\nHenrietta; always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always\\r\\nwith the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In\\r\\ngeneral, his voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrietta\\r\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only, when she had\\r\\nbeen grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb,\\r\\nbitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, he burst forth, as\\r\\nif wholly overcome--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t talk of it, don\\'t talk of it,\" he cried.  \"Oh God! that I had\\r\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!  But\\r\\nso eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the\\r\\njustness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and\\r\\nadvantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him\\r\\nthat, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its\\r\\nproportions and limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to\\r\\nfeel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of\\r\\nhappiness as a very resolute character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and\\r\\nthe same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by some dread\\r\\nof the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long as on the day\\r\\nbefore.  It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in the\\r\\nneighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence among\\r\\nthem for some time, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawl\\r\\nover her face, giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep;\\r\\nwhen, as they were going up their last hill, Anne found herself all at\\r\\nonce addressed by Captain Wentworth.  In a low, cautious voice, he\\r\\nsaid:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not appear at\\r\\nfirst.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether you had\\r\\nnot better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in and break it\\r\\nto Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance of\\r\\nthe appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship, and of\\r\\ndeference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became a\\r\\nsort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and he had\\r\\nseen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped, and the\\r\\ndaughter all the better for being with them, he announced his intention\\r\\nof returning in the same carriage to Lyme; and when the horses were\\r\\nbaited, he was off.\\r\\n\\r\\n(End of volume one.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remainder of Anne\\'s time at Uppercross, comprehending only two\\r\\ndays, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the\\r\\nsatisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an\\r\\nimmediate companion, and as assisting in all those arrangements for the\\r\\nfuture, which, in Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s distressed state of spirits,\\r\\nwould have been difficulties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was much\\r\\nthe same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.  Charles came a\\r\\nfew hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account.  He\\r\\nwas tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure must not be hoped, but\\r\\neverything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted.  In\\r\\nspeaking of the Harvilles, he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of\\r\\ntheir kindness, especially of Mrs Harville\\'s exertions as a nurse.\\r\\n\"She really left nothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been\\r\\npersuaded to go early to their inn last night.  Mary had been\\r\\nhysterical again this morning.  When he came away, she was going to\\r\\nwalk out with Captain Benwick, which, he hoped, would do her good.  He\\r\\nalmost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before;\\r\\nbut the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had at\\r\\nfirst half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.  It\\r\\nwould be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase his\\r\\nown distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon.  A\\r\\nchaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far\\r\\nmore useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who\\r\\nhaving brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the\\r\\nlingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his\\r\\nbrothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and\\r\\ndress all the blains and bruises she could get near her, and who,\\r\\nconsequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse\\r\\ndear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither, had occurred\\r\\nbefore to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta; but without Anne, it would hardly\\r\\nhave been resolved on, and found practicable so soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all the minute\\r\\nknowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain every\\r\\ntwenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme, and his\\r\\naccount was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense and\\r\\nconsciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed in\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s appearing fixed in Lyme.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\\r\\n\"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters for\\r\\none another.\"  And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought she\\r\\ncould not do better than impart among them the general inclination to\\r\\nwhich she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.  She\\r\\nhad little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; go\\r\\nto-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as it\\r\\nsuited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.  They must be\\r\\ntaking off some trouble from the good people she was with; they might\\r\\nat least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children; and in\\r\\nshort, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted with\\r\\nwhat she had done, and felt that she could not spend her last morning\\r\\nat Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sending\\r\\nthem off at an early hour, though her being left to the solitary range\\r\\nof the house was the consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, she was the\\r\\nvery last, the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated\\r\\nboth houses, of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character.\\r\\nA few days had made a change indeed!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than former\\r\\nhappiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt, to her mind\\r\\nthere was none, of what would follow her recovery.  A few months hence,\\r\\nand the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self,\\r\\nmight be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was\\r\\nglowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anne\\r\\nElliot!\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour\\'s complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a dark\\r\\nNovember day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few\\r\\nobjects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the\\r\\nsound of Lady Russell\\'s carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, though\\r\\ndesirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House, or look an\\r\\nadieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda,\\r\\nor even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of\\r\\nthe village, without a saddened heart.  Scenes had passed in Uppercross\\r\\nwhich made it precious.  It stood the record of many sensations of\\r\\npain, once severe, but now softened; and of some instances of relenting\\r\\nfeeling, some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could\\r\\nnever be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.  She\\r\\nleft it all behind her, all but the recollection that such things had\\r\\nbeen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell\\'s house\\r\\nin September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of its\\r\\nbeing possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and\\r\\nescape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\r\\nand elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes of its\\r\\nmistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell\\'s joy in meeting her.\\r\\nShe knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily, either Anne\\r\\nwas improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell fancied her so;\\r\\nand Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion, had the\\r\\namusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin,\\r\\nand of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth\\r\\nand beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental\\r\\nchange.  The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving\\r\\nKellynch, and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to\\r\\nsmother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\\r\\nShe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.\\r\\nTheir concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross; and when Lady\\r\\nRussell reverted to their former hopes and fears, and spoke her\\r\\nsatisfaction in the house in Camden Place, which had been taken, and\\r\\nher regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them, Anne would have\\r\\nbeen ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme\\r\\nand Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintance there; how much more\\r\\ninteresting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and\\r\\nCaptain Benwick, than her own father\\'s house in Camden Place, or her\\r\\nown sister\\'s intimacy with Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert\\r\\nherself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal\\r\\nsolicitude, on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another\\r\\nsubject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.  Lady Russell had\\r\\nnot been arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account of\\r\\nthe whole had burst on her; but still it must be talked of, she must\\r\\nmake enquiries, she must regret the imprudence, lament the result, and\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s name must be mentioned by both.  Anne was conscious\\r\\nof not doing it so well as Lady Russell.  She could not speak the name,\\r\\nand look straight forward to Lady Russell\\'s eye, till she had adopted\\r\\nthe expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment\\r\\nbetween him and Louisa.  When this was told, his name distressed her no\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but\\r\\ninternally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\\r\\nthat the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of\\r\\nthe value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed\\r\\nby a Louisa Musgrove.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\\r\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, which\\r\\nfound their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought a rather\\r\\nimproving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period, Lady Russell\\'s\\r\\npoliteness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings of\\r\\nthe past became in a decided tone, \"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really\\r\\nmust call upon her soon.  Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay\\r\\na visit in that house?  It will be some trial to us both.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she\\r\\nsaid, in observing--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your\\r\\nfeelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.  By remaining in\\r\\nthe neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact so high an\\r\\nopinion of the Crofts, and considered her father so very fortunate in\\r\\nhis tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the\\r\\npoor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed\\r\\nfor the necessity of the removal, she could not but in conscience feel\\r\\nthat they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall\\r\\nhad passed into better hands than its owners\\'.  These convictions must\\r\\nunquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they\\r\\nprecluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the\\r\\nhouse again, and returning through the well-known apartments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself, \"These rooms\\r\\nought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen in their destination!  How\\r\\nunworthily occupied!  An ancient family to be so driven away!\\r\\nStrangers filling their place!\" No, except when she thought of her\\r\\nmother, and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside, she\\r\\nhad no sigh of that description to heave.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of\\r\\nfancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receiving\\r\\nher in that house, there was particular attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic, and on\\r\\ncomparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that each\\r\\nlady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn; that\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time since\\r\\nthe accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had not been\\r\\nable to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours and then\\r\\nreturned again to Lyme, and without any present intention of quitting\\r\\nit any more.  He had enquired after her, she found, particularly; had\\r\\nexpressed his hope of Miss Elliot\\'s not being the worse for her\\r\\nexertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.  This was\\r\\nhandsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could\\r\\nhave done.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one\\r\\nstyle by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to\\r\\nwork on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had\\r\\nbeen the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that\\r\\nits effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how\\r\\nlong Miss Musgrove\\'s recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable she\\r\\nwould still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!  The\\r\\nAdmiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this, for a young\\r\\nfellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress\\'s head, is not it,\\r\\nMiss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Croft\\'s manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady\\r\\nRussell, but they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity\\r\\nof character were irresistible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from a\\r\\nlittle reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  I had not\\r\\nrecollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.  But now, do\\r\\nnot stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms in the house\\r\\nif you like it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery at\\r\\nany time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by\\r\\nthat door.  A good place is not it?  But,\" (checking himself), \"you\\r\\nwill not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the\\r\\nbutler\\'s room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.  One man\\'s ways may be\\r\\nas good as another\\'s, but we all like our own best.  And so you must\\r\\njudge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the\\r\\nhouse or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have made very few changes either,\" continued the Admiral, after\\r\\nthinking a moment.  \"Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door, at\\r\\nUppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.  The wonder was,\\r\\nhow any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its\\r\\nopening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter what we have\\r\\ndone, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house\\r\\never had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few\\r\\nalterations we have made have been all very much for the better.  My\\r\\nwife should have the credit of them, however.  I have done very little\\r\\nbesides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my\\r\\ndressing-room, which was your father\\'s.  A very good man, and very much\\r\\nthe gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking\\r\\nwith serious reflection), \"I should think he must be rather a dressy\\r\\nman for his time of life.  Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord!\\r\\nthere was no getting away from one\\'s self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a\\r\\nhand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with\\r\\nmy little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I\\r\\nnever go near.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\\r\\nand the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough, took up\\r\\nthe subject again, to say--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give\\r\\nhim my compliments and Mrs Croft\\'s, and say that we are settled here\\r\\nquite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place.\\r\\nThe breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only\\r\\nwhen the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen three\\r\\ntimes a winter.  And take it altogether, now that we have been into\\r\\nmost of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we\\r\\nlike better than this.  Pray say so, with my compliments.  He will be\\r\\nglad to hear it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other: but\\r\\nthe acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at\\r\\npresent; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves to\\r\\nbe going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the north\\r\\nof the county, and probably might not be at home again before Lady\\r\\nRussell would be removing to Bath.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch\\r\\nHall, or of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safe\\r\\nenough, and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on\\r\\nthe subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 14\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and\\r\\nMrs Musgrove\\'s going than Anne conceived they could have been at all\\r\\nwanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and\\r\\nas soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to\\r\\nthe Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her head,\\r\\nthough clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves susceptible to the\\r\\nhighest extreme of tenderness; and though she might be pronounced to be\\r\\naltogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when she\\r\\nmight be able to bear the removal home; and her father and mother, who\\r\\nmust return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas\\r\\nholidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs\\r\\nHarville\\'s children away as much as she could, every possible supply\\r\\nfrom Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the\\r\\nHarvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner\\r\\nevery day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each\\r\\nside as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by her\\r\\nstaying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.  Charles\\r\\nHayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when they dined\\r\\nwith the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and at\\r\\nfirst Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence; but then,\\r\\nshe had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out\\r\\nwhose daughter she was, and there had been so much going on every day,\\r\\nthere had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles,\\r\\nand she had got books from the library, and changed them so often, that\\r\\nthe balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme.  She had been\\r\\ntaken to Charmouth too, and she had bathed, and she had gone to church,\\r\\nand there were a great many more people to look at in the church at\\r\\nLyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being so\\r\\nvery useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne enquired after Captain Benwick. Mary\\'s face was clouded directly.\\r\\nCharles laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is a very odd\\r\\nyoung man.  I do not know what he would be at.  We asked him to come\\r\\nhome with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook to give him some\\r\\nshooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it\\r\\nwas all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night, he made a very awkward\\r\\nsort of excuse; \\'he never shot\\' and he had \\'been quite misunderstood,\\'\\r\\nand he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end of it\\r\\nwas, I found, that he did not mean to come.  I suppose he was afraid of\\r\\nfinding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively\\r\\nenough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles laughed again and said, \"Now Mary, you know very well how it\\r\\nreally was.  It was all your doing,\" (turning to Anne.) \"He fancied\\r\\nthat if he went with us, he should find you close by: he fancied\\r\\neverybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that Lady\\r\\nRussell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he had not\\r\\ncourage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour. Mary knows it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from not\\r\\nconsidering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in\\r\\nlove with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater\\r\\nattraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed.\\r\\nAnne\\'s good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she heard.\\r\\nShe boldly acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her enquiries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! he talks of you,\" cried Charles, \"in such terms--\" Mary\\r\\ninterrupted him. \"I declare, Charles, I never heard him mention Anne\\r\\ntwice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne, he never talks of you\\r\\nat all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" admitted Charles, \"I do not know that he ever does, in a general\\r\\nway; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you\\r\\nexceedingly.  His head is full of some books that he is reading upon\\r\\nyour recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about them; he has\\r\\nfound out something or other in one of them which he thinks--oh! I\\r\\ncannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I\\r\\noverheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then \\'Miss Elliot\\'\\r\\nwas spoken of in the highest terms!  Now Mary, I declare it was so, I\\r\\nheard it myself, and you were in the other room.  \\'Elegance, sweetness,\\r\\nbeauty.\\' Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot\\'s charms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his\\r\\ncredit, if he did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart is\\r\\nvery little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure you will\\r\\nagree with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell,\\r\\nsmiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma\\'am,\"\\r\\nsaid Charles.  \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us, and\\r\\nsetting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he will make\\r\\nhis way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it.  I\\r\\ntold him the distance and the road, and I told him of the church\\'s\\r\\nbeing so very well worth seeing; for as he has a taste for those sort\\r\\nof things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened with\\r\\nall his understanding and soul; and I am sure from his manner that you\\r\\nwill have him calling here soon.  So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Any acquaintance of Anne\\'s will always be welcome to me,\" was Lady\\r\\nRussell\\'s kind answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! as to being Anne\\'s acquaintance,\" said Mary, \"I think he is rather\\r\\nmy acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last\\r\\nfortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see\\r\\nCaptain Benwick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma\\'am.\\r\\nHe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with\\r\\nme, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a\\r\\nword.  He is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not\\r\\nlike him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There we differ, Mary,\" said Anne.  \"I think Lady Russell would like\\r\\nhim.  I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she\\r\\nwould very soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles.  \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him.\\r\\nHe is just Lady Russell\\'s sort.  Give him a book, and he will read all\\r\\nday long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, that he will!\" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  \"He will sit poring\\r\\nover his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\\r\\ndrops one\\'s scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think Lady\\r\\nRussell would like that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell could not help laughing.  \"Upon my word,\" said she, \"I\\r\\nshould not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted\\r\\nof such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may\\r\\ncall myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give\\r\\noccasion to such directly opposite notions.  I wish he may be induced\\r\\nto call here.  And when he does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing my\\r\\nopinion; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will not like him, I will answer for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with\\r\\nanimation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so\\r\\nextraordinarily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see.  His\\r\\ndeclining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has left\\r\\na very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis decision checked Mary\\'s eagerness, and stopped her short in the\\r\\nmidst of the Elliot countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,\\r\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been\\r\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved, he\\r\\nhad improved, and he was now quite a different creature from what he\\r\\nhad been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa; and was so extremely\\r\\nfearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he did\\r\\nnot press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of\\r\\ngoing away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had\\r\\ntalked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade\\r\\nCaptain Benwick to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last,\\r\\nCaptain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally\\r\\nthinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.  Lady Russell could not\\r\\nhear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald; nor\\r\\ncould Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her\\r\\nfather\\'s grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without\\r\\nwondering whether she might see him or hear of him.  Captain Benwick\\r\\ncame not, however.  He was either less disposed for it than Charles had\\r\\nimagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him a week\\'s indulgence,\\r\\nLady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had\\r\\nbeen beginning to excite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from\\r\\nschool, bringing with them Mrs Harville\\'s little children, to improve\\r\\nthe noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained\\r\\nwith Louisa; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual\\r\\nquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Anne\\r\\ncould not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.\\r\\nThough neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain\\r\\nWentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could\\r\\nbe wished to the last state she had seen it in.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom\\r\\nshe was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from\\r\\nthe Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side was a table\\r\\noccupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and\\r\\non the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn\\r\\nand cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole\\r\\ncompleted by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be\\r\\nheard, in spite of all the noise of the others.  Charles and Mary also\\r\\ncame in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of\\r\\npaying his respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten\\r\\nminutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the\\r\\nchildren on his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed such a\\r\\ndomestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa\\'s\\r\\nillness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove, who got Anne\\r\\nnear her on purpose to thank her most cordially, again and again, for\\r\\nall her attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of what\\r\\nshe had suffered herself by observing, with a happy glance round the\\r\\nroom, that after all she had gone through, nothing was so likely to do\\r\\nher good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her\\r\\nbeing able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\\r\\nwent to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her and\\r\\nstay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,\\r\\nfor the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope I shall remember, in future,\" said Lady Russell, as soon as\\r\\nthey were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross in the\\r\\nChristmas holidays.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and\\r\\nsounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather\\r\\nthan their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards, was\\r\\nentering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course\\r\\nof streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash of\\r\\nother carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of\\r\\nnewspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of\\r\\npattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises which belonged\\r\\nto the winter pleasures; her spirits rose under their influence; and\\r\\nlike Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling, though not saying, that after being\\r\\nlong in the country, nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet\\r\\ncheerfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,\\r\\nthough very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view\\r\\nof the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing\\r\\nthem better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however\\r\\ndisagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her when she\\r\\narrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of\\r\\nUppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some\\r\\ninterest.  Mr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had\\r\\ncalled a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If\\r\\nElizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking\\r\\nmuch pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the\\r\\nconnection, as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was\\r\\nvery wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very\\r\\nagreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting\\r\\nthe sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man\\r\\nwhom she had no wish to see.\"  She had a great wish to see him.  If he\\r\\nreally sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be\\r\\nforgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but she\\r\\nfelt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was more\\r\\nthan she could say for many other persons in Bath.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her\\r\\nown lodgings, in Rivers Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a lofty\\r\\ndignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both he\\r\\nand Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of\\r\\nmany months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I leave\\r\\nyou again?\"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome\\r\\nshe received, did her good.  Her father and sister were glad to see\\r\\nher, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture, and met her\\r\\nwith kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was\\r\\nnoticed as an advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and\\r\\nsmiles were more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she\\r\\nwould pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of\\r\\nthe others was unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,\\r\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination to\\r\\nlisten to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being deeply\\r\\nregretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, they\\r\\nhad only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all\\r\\ntheir own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it\\r\\nwas all Bath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered\\r\\ntheir expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly the\\r\\nbest in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\\r\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the\\r\\nsuperiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste\\r\\nof the furniture.  Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.\\r\\nEverybody was wanting to visit them.  They had drawn back from many\\r\\nintroductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people\\r\\nof whom they knew nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father and\\r\\nsister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh that her\\r\\nfather should feel no degradation in his change, should see nothing to\\r\\nregret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should\\r\\nfind so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she must\\r\\nsigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open the\\r\\nfolding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the\\r\\nother, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, who\\r\\nhad been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of\\r\\nbetween two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was not all which they had to make them happy.  They had Mr\\r\\nElliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.  He was not\\r\\nonly pardoned, they were delighted with him.  He had been in Bath about\\r\\na fortnight; (he had passed through Bath in November, in his way to\\r\\nLondon, when the intelligence of Sir Walter\\'s being settled there had\\r\\nof course reached him, though only twenty-four hours in the place, but\\r\\nhe had not been able to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a\\r\\nfortnight in Bath, and his first object on arriving, had been to leave\\r\\nhis card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours\\r\\nto meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\\r\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be\\r\\nreceived as a relation again, that their former good understanding was\\r\\ncompletely re-established.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away all the\\r\\nappearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated in\\r\\nmisapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of throwing himself\\r\\noff; he had feared that he was thrown off, but knew not why, and\\r\\ndelicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint of having spoken\\r\\ndisrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he\\r\\nwas quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and\\r\\nwhose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the\\r\\nunfeudal tone of the present day.  He was astonished, indeed, but his\\r\\ncharacter and general conduct must refute it.  He could refer Sir\\r\\nWalter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking\\r\\non this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the\\r\\nfooting of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his\\r\\nopinions on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of much\\r\\nextenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but\\r\\na very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable\\r\\nman, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter\\r\\nadded), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and\\r\\nhad, at his own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance\\r\\nthrough Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the\\r\\nmarriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted also\\r\\nwith his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.  She was\\r\\ncertainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich,\\r\\nand excessively in love with his friend.  There had been the charm.\\r\\nShe had sought him.  Without that attraction, not all her money would\\r\\nhave tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her\\r\\nhaving been a very fine woman.  Here was a great deal to soften the\\r\\nbusiness.  A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him!\\r\\nSir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, she\\r\\nallowed it be a great extenuation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently\\r\\ndelighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners\\r\\nin general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and\\r\\nplacing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances, large\\r\\nallowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\\r\\nShe heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant or\\r\\nirrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\r\\nbut in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had the\\r\\nsensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in\\r\\nMr Elliot\\'s wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well\\r\\nreceived by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain by being\\r\\non terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.  In\\r\\nall probability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch\\r\\nestate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.  A sensible man,\\r\\nand he had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object\\r\\nto him?  She could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s sake.  There might really have been a liking formerly,\\r\\nthough convenience and accident had drawn him a different way; and now\\r\\nthat he could afford to please himself, he might mean to pay his\\r\\naddresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with\\r\\nwell-bred, elegant manners, and her character might never have been\\r\\npenetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public, and when very young\\r\\nhimself.  How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation\\r\\nof his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a\\r\\nfearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too\\r\\nnice, or too observant if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabeth\\r\\nwas disposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs Clay was\\r\\nencouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them,\\r\\nwhile Mr Elliot\\'s frequent visits were talked of.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without\\r\\nbeing much attended to.  \"Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.\\r\\nThey did not know.  It might be him, perhaps.\"  They could not listen\\r\\nto her description of him.  They were describing him themselves; Sir\\r\\nWalter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\r\\nappearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face, his\\r\\nsensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being very much\\r\\nunder-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could he\\r\\npretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for\\r\\nthe worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think that he (Sir Walter) was\\r\\nlooking exactly as he had done when they last parted;\" but Sir Walter\\r\\nhad \"not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had\\r\\nembarrassed him.  He did not mean to complain, however.  Mr Elliot was\\r\\nbetter to look at than most men, and he had no objection to being seen\\r\\nwith him anywhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the\\r\\nwhole evening.  \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced\\r\\nto them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\" and there was a Mrs\\r\\nWallis, at present known only to them by description, as she was in\\r\\ndaily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as \"a\\r\\nmost charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place,\" and\\r\\nas soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.  Sir Walter\\r\\nthought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be an excessively pretty\\r\\nwoman, beautiful.  \"He longed to see her.  He hoped she might make some\\r\\namends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the\\r\\nstreets.  The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women.  He did\\r\\nnot mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the\\r\\nplain was out of all proportion.  He had frequently observed, as he\\r\\nwalked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or\\r\\nfive-and-thirty frights; and once, as he had stood in a shop on Bond\\r\\nStreet, he had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another,\\r\\nwithout there being a tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty\\r\\nmorning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a\\r\\nthousand could stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were a\\r\\ndreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!  they\\r\\nwere infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\r\\nIt was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\r\\ntolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.  He\\r\\nhad never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a\\r\\nfine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing that every\\r\\nwoman\\'s eye was upon him; every woman\\'s eye was sure to be upon Colonel\\r\\nWallis.\"  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed to escape, however.\\r\\nHis daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis\\'s\\r\\ncompanion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly\\r\\nwas not sandy-haired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How is Mary looking?\" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good\\r\\nhumour.  \"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that\\r\\nmay not happen every day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she has been\\r\\nin very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds, and grow\\r\\ncoarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,\\r\\nor a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the\\r\\ndoor suspended everything.  \"A knock at the door! and so late!  It was\\r\\nten o\\'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine in\\r\\nLansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home\\r\\nto ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.  Mrs Clay\\r\\ndecidedly thought it Mr Elliot\\'s knock.\"  Mrs Clay was right.  With all\\r\\nthe state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr Elliot was ushered\\r\\ninto the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.\\r\\nAnne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments, and\\r\\nher sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour, but \"he\\r\\ncould not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her\\r\\nfriend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was all as\\r\\npolitely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part must\\r\\nfollow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter; \"Mr Elliot\\r\\nmust give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\" (there was\\r\\nno occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, very\\r\\nbecomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no\\r\\nmeans forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at his little start\\r\\nof surprise, that he had not been at all aware of who she was.  He\\r\\nlooked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; his\\r\\neyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the\\r\\nrelationship, alluded to the past, and entreated to be received as an\\r\\nacquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking as he had appeared\\r\\nat Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking, and his manners were so\\r\\nexactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularly\\r\\nagreeable, that she could compare them in excellence to only one\\r\\nperson\\'s manners.  They were not the same, but they were, perhaps,\\r\\nequally good.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.\\r\\nThere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes were\\r\\nenough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions, his choice of\\r\\nsubject, his knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a\\r\\nsensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could, he began to talk to\\r\\nher of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but\\r\\nespecially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to\\r\\nbe guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his own route,\\r\\nunderstand something of hers, and regret that he should have lost such\\r\\nan opportunity of paying his respects to her.  She gave him a short\\r\\naccount of her party and business at Lyme.  His regret increased as he\\r\\nlistened.  He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room\\r\\nadjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they\\r\\nmust be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but\\r\\ncertainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow\\r\\nof a right to introduce himself.  If he had but asked who the party\\r\\nwere!  The name of Musgrove would have told him enough.  \"Well, it\\r\\nwould serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a\\r\\nquestion at an inn, which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on\\r\\nthe principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he, \"as to\\r\\nwhat is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing, are more\\r\\nabsurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world.\\r\\nThe folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the\\r\\nfolly of what they have in view.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone: he knew\\r\\nit; he was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only at\\r\\nintervals that he could return to Lyme.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene she\\r\\nhad been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.  Having\\r\\nalluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.  When he questioned,\\r\\nSir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also, but the difference in\\r\\ntheir manner of doing it could not be unfelt.  She could only compare\\r\\nMr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish of really comprehending what had\\r\\npassed, and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in\\r\\nwitnessing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece\\r\\nhad struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman was\\r\\nbeginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before Mr\\r\\nElliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\r\\nCamden Place could have passed so well!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one point which Anne, on returning to her family, would have\\r\\nbeen more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot\\'s being in love\\r\\nwith Elizabeth, which was, her father\\'s not being in love with Mrs\\r\\nClay; and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been at\\r\\nhome a few hours.  On going down to breakfast the next morning, she\\r\\nfound there had just been a decent pretence on the lady\\'s side of\\r\\nmeaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said, that\\r\\n\"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself at all wanted;\"\\r\\nfor Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper, \"That must not be any\\r\\nreason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.  She is nothing to me,\\r\\ncompared with you;\"  and she was in full time to hear her father say,\\r\\n\"My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet, you have seen nothing of\\r\\nBath.  You have been here only to be useful.  You must not run away\\r\\nfrom us now.  You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis, the\\r\\nbeautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind, I well know the sight of\\r\\nbeauty is a real gratification.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised to\\r\\nsee Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.  Her\\r\\ncountenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise\\r\\nof the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister.  The\\r\\nlady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be\\r\\nalone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks; he\\r\\nthought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, her\\r\\ncomplexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been using any\\r\\nthing in particular?\"  \"No, nothing.\"  \"Merely Gowland,\" he supposed.\\r\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"  \"Ha! he was surprised at that;\" and added,\\r\\n\"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot\\r\\nbe better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of\\r\\nGowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been using it at my\\r\\nrecommendation, and you see what it has done for her.  You see how it\\r\\nhas carried away her freckles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise might\\r\\nhave struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne that the\\r\\nfreckles were at all lessened.  But everything must take its chance.\\r\\nThe evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also\\r\\nto marry.  As for herself, she might always command a home with Lady\\r\\nRussell.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\r\\non this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs\\r\\nClay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual\\r\\nprovocation to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a\\r\\nperson in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and\\r\\nhas a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable, or more\\r\\nindifferent, towards the others.  His manners were an immediate\\r\\nrecommendation; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully\\r\\nsupporting the superficial, that she was at first, as she told Anne,\\r\\nalmost ready to exclaim, \"Can this be Mr Elliot?\" and could not\\r\\nseriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man.\\r\\nEverything united in him; good understanding, correct opinions,\\r\\nknowledge of the world, and a warm heart.  He had strong feelings of\\r\\nfamily attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; he\\r\\nlived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he\\r\\njudged for himself in everything essential, without defying public\\r\\nopinion in any point of worldly decorum.  He was steady, observant,\\r\\nmoderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness,\\r\\nwhich fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility to\\r\\nwhat was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of\\r\\ndomestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent\\r\\nagitation seldom really possess.  She was sure that he had not been\\r\\nhappy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it;\\r\\nbut it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty\\r\\nsoon to suspect) to prevent his thinking of a second choice.  Her\\r\\nsatisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her\\r\\nexcellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did not\\r\\nsurprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell should see nothing\\r\\nsuspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives than\\r\\nappeared, in Mr Elliot\\'s great desire of a reconciliation.  In Lady\\r\\nRussell\\'s view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot, at a mature\\r\\ntime of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what would\\r\\nvery generally recommend him among all sensible people, to be on good\\r\\nterms with the head of his family; the simplest process in the world of\\r\\ntime upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of\\r\\nyouth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last to\\r\\nmention \"Elizabeth.\"  Lady Russell listened, and looked, and made only\\r\\nthis cautious reply:--\"Elizabeth! very well; time will explain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little\\r\\nobservation, felt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at\\r\\npresent.  In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the\\r\\nhabit of such general observance as \"Miss Elliot,\" that any\\r\\nparticularity of attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,\\r\\nit must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.  A little\\r\\ndelay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact, Anne could never\\r\\nsee the crape round his hat, without fearing that she was the\\r\\ninexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations; for though\\r\\nhis marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many\\r\\nyears that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the\\r\\nawful impression of its being dissolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever it might end, he was without any question their pleasantest\\r\\nacquaintance in Bath:  she saw nobody equal to him; and it was a great\\r\\nindulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme, which he seemed to\\r\\nhave as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself.\\r\\nThey went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many\\r\\ntimes.  He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some\\r\\nearnestness.  She knew it well; and she remembered another person\\'s\\r\\nlook also.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion she\\r\\nperceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance, it\\r\\nmust be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly into her\\r\\nfather and sister\\'s solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy\\r\\nto excite them.  The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of\\r\\nthe Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and her daughter, the Honourable\\r\\nMiss Carteret; and all the comfort of No. --, Camden Place, was swept\\r\\naway for many days; for the Dalrymples (in Anne\\'s opinion, most\\r\\nunfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots; and the agony was how to\\r\\nintroduce themselves properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with\\r\\nnobility, and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hoped\\r\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and\\r\\nwas reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen; a wish that\\r\\nthey had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss\\r\\nCarteret;\" \"our cousins, the Dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears all day\\r\\nlong.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount, but had\\r\\nnever seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the\\r\\ncase arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by\\r\\nletters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\\r\\nwhen, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter\\'s at the same\\r\\ntime, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.  No letter of\\r\\ncondolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect had been visited on\\r\\nthe head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no\\r\\nletter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there\\r\\nwas but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the\\r\\nrelationship as closed.  How to have this anxious business set to\\r\\nrights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question:  and it was\\r\\na question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor\\r\\nMr Elliot thought unimportant.  \"Family connexions were always worth\\r\\npreserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken\\r\\na house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in\\r\\nstyle.  She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had\\r\\nheard her spoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that\\r\\nthe connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\\r\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote a\\r\\nvery fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his\\r\\nright honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could\\r\\nadmire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing three\\r\\nlines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.  \"She was very much\\r\\nhonoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\" The toils of the\\r\\nbusiness were over, the sweets began.  They visited in Laura Place,\\r\\nthey had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and the Honourable\\r\\nMiss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible:  and\\r\\n\"Our cousins in Laura Place,\"--\"Our cousin, Lady Dalrymple and Miss\\r\\nCarteret,\" were talked of to everybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very\\r\\nagreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they\\r\\ncreated, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,\\r\\naccomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name\\r\\nof \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer for\\r\\neverybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so\\r\\nawkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but\\r\\nfor her birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet \"it\\r\\nwas an acquaintance worth having;\" and when Anne ventured to speak her\\r\\nopinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing in\\r\\nthemselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good\\r\\ncompany, as those who would collect good company around them, they had\\r\\ntheir value.  Anne smiled and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,\\r\\nwell-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is\\r\\nwhat I call good company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company; that is\\r\\nthe best.  Good company requires only birth, education, and manners,\\r\\nand with regard to education is not very nice.  Birth and good manners\\r\\nare essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing\\r\\nin good company; on the contrary, it will do very well.  My cousin Anne\\r\\nshakes her head.  She is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dear\\r\\ncousin\" (sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be\\r\\nfastidious than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?\\r\\nWill it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society of\\r\\nthose good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages of the\\r\\nconnexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it, that they will\\r\\nmove in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, your\\r\\nbeing known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your\\r\\nfamily (our family let me say) in that degree of consideration which we\\r\\nmust all wish for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" sighed Anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"\\r\\nthen recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,\\r\\n\"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to\\r\\nprocure the acquaintance.  I suppose\" (smiling) \"I have more pride than\\r\\nany of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so\\r\\nsolicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very\\r\\nsure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.  In London,\\r\\nperhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say:\\r\\nbut in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth\\r\\nknowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome\\r\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.  But here you\\r\\nare in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the\\r\\ncredit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.  You\\r\\ntalk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to\\r\\nbelieve myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have\\r\\nthe same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little\\r\\ndifferent.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,\" (he continued,\\r\\nspeaking lower, though there was no one else in the room) \"in one\\r\\npoint, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that every addition\\r\\nto your father\\'s society, among his equals or superiors, may be of use\\r\\nin diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately\\r\\noccupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant; and\\r\\nthough Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,\\r\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience\\r\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her father\\'s getting great\\r\\nacquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good\\r\\nfortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very\\r\\ndifferent description.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had called on her former governess, and had heard from her of there\\r\\nbeing an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on\\r\\nher attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,\\r\\nnow Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her\\r\\nlife when it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,\\r\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved, feeling\\r\\nher separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of\\r\\nstrong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;\\r\\nand Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the\\r\\nwant of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at\\r\\nschool, had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably\\r\\nlessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, was\\r\\nsaid to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne had\\r\\nknown of her, till now that their governess\\'s account brought her\\r\\nsituation forward in a more decided but very different form.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant; and at his\\r\\ndeath, about two years before, had left his affairs dreadfully\\r\\ninvolved.  She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and\\r\\nin addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe\\r\\nrheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs, had made her for\\r\\nthe present a cripple.  She had come to Bath on that account, and was\\r\\nnow in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable\\r\\neven to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost\\r\\nexcluded from society.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from\\r\\nMiss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in\\r\\ngoing.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard, or what she\\r\\nintended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.  She only\\r\\nconsulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments, and\\r\\nwas most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith\\'s lodgings in\\r\\nWestgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest\\r\\nin each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes had its\\r\\nawkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone since they had\\r\\nparted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the\\r\\nother had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming,\\r\\nsilent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of\\r\\nseven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as\\r\\nconsciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had\\r\\ntransformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow\\r\\nof health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless\\r\\nwidow, receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour; but all\\r\\nthat was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left\\r\\nonly the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and\\r\\ntalking over old times.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she\\r\\nhad almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be\\r\\ncheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations of the\\r\\npast--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions of\\r\\nthe present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her\\r\\nheart or ruined her spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, and\\r\\nAnne\\'s astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine a more\\r\\ncheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith\\'s.  She had been very fond\\r\\nof her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been used to affluence:\\r\\nit was gone.  She had no child to connect her with life and happiness\\r\\nagain, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs,\\r\\nno health to make all the rest supportable.  Her accommodations were\\r\\nlimited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no\\r\\npossibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which\\r\\nthere was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never\\r\\nquitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.  Yet, in spite\\r\\nof all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of\\r\\nlanguor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.  How\\r\\ncould it be?  She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined\\r\\nthat this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.  A\\r\\nsubmissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply\\r\\nresolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of\\r\\nmind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily\\r\\nfrom evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of\\r\\nherself, which was from nature alone.  It was the choicest gift of\\r\\nHeaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which,\\r\\nby a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost\\r\\nevery other want.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits had nearly\\r\\nfailed.  She could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her\\r\\nstate on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable\\r\\nobject; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken\\r\\npossession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and\\r\\nsuffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers,\\r\\nwith the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at\\r\\nthat moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.  She\\r\\nhad weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her\\r\\ngood.  It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be\\r\\nin good hands.  She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or\\r\\ndisinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her\\r\\nthat her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her\\r\\nill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister\\r\\nof her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in\\r\\nthat house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to\\r\\nattend her.  \"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most\\r\\nadmirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I\\r\\ncould use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great\\r\\namusement; and she put me in the way of making these little\\r\\nthread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so\\r\\nbusy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\r\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.  She had a\\r\\nlarge acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can\\r\\nafford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.  She always takes\\r\\nthe right time for applying.  Everybody\\'s heart is open, you know, when\\r\\nthey have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the\\r\\nblessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to\\r\\nspeak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.  Hers is a line\\r\\nfor seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and\\r\\nobservation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to\\r\\nthousands of those who having only received \\'the best education in the\\r\\nworld,\\' know nothing worth attending to.  Call it gossip, if you will,\\r\\nbut when Nurse Rooke has half an hour\\'s leisure to bestow on me, she is\\r\\nsure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable:\\r\\nsomething that makes one know one\\'s species better.  One likes to hear\\r\\nwhat is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being\\r\\ntrifling and silly.  To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I\\r\\nassure you, is a treat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, \"I can easily\\r\\nbelieve it.  Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they\\r\\nare intelligent may be well worth listening to.  Such varieties of\\r\\nhuman nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!  And it is not\\r\\nmerely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it\\r\\noccasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or\\r\\naffecting.  What instances must pass before them of ardent,\\r\\ndisinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\\r\\npatience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\r\\nthat ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of\\r\\nvolumes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may, though I fear\\r\\nits lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.  Here and\\r\\nthere, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally\\r\\nspeaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a\\r\\nsick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity\\r\\nand fortitude, that one hears of.  There is so little real friendship\\r\\nin the world! and unfortunately\" (speaking low and tremulously) \"there\\r\\nare so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been what he\\r\\nought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made\\r\\nher think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.  It was but a\\r\\npassing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soon\\r\\nadded in a different tone--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,\\r\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing\\r\\nMrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\\r\\nfashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report\\r\\nbut of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis,\\r\\nhowever.  She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all the\\r\\nhigh-priced things I have in hand now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had called several times on her friend, before the existence of\\r\\nsuch a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary\\r\\nto speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one\\r\\nmorning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\\r\\nfor the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that\\r\\nevening in Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.  They\\r\\nwere only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at\\r\\nhome by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had\\r\\nbeen so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with great\\r\\nalacrity--\"She was engaged to spend the evening with an old\\r\\nschoolfellow.\"  They were not much interested in anything relative to\\r\\nAnne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it\\r\\nunderstood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was\\r\\ndisdainful, and Sir Walter severe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be\\r\\nvisiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith; and\\r\\nwho was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to\\r\\nbe met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?  That she is old\\r\\nand sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most\\r\\nextraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts other people, low\\r\\ncompany, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting\\r\\nto you.  But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow:  she\\r\\nis not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see another\\r\\nday.  What is her age?  Forty?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off\\r\\nmy engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will\\r\\nat once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath to-morrow,\\r\\nand for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied Anne; \"on the contrary, she\\r\\napproves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs\\r\\nSmith.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\r\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed Sir Walter.  \"Sir\\r\\nHenry Russell\\'s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,\\r\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to\\r\\nconvey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!\\r\\nA poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs\\r\\nSmith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in the\\r\\nworld, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred\\r\\nby her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and\\r\\nIreland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\\r\\nadvisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did\\r\\nlong to say a little in defence of her friend\\'s not very dissimilar\\r\\nclaims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her father\\r\\nprevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it to himself to\\r\\nrecollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty\\r\\nand forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she\\r\\nheard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.  She had\\r\\nbeen the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had\\r\\nnot only been quite at her ladyship\\'s service themselves, but had\\r\\nactually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and had\\r\\nbeen at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and Mr\\r\\nElliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady\\r\\nRussell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait\\r\\non her.  Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could\\r\\nsupply from Lady Russell.  To her, its greatest interest must be, in\\r\\nhaving been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; in\\r\\nhaving been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for\\r\\nstaying away in such a cause.  Her kind, compassionate visits to this\\r\\nold schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr\\r\\nElliot.  He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her\\r\\ntemper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet\\r\\neven Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be\\r\\ngiven to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be\\r\\nso highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable\\r\\nsensations which her friend meant to create.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.\\r\\nShe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his\\r\\ndeserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which\\r\\nwould free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and\\r\\nleave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.  She\\r\\nwould not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the\\r\\nsubject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be\\r\\nhereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness\\r\\nof the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.\\r\\nAnne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled,\\r\\nblushed, and gently shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell, \"being much\\r\\ntoo well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.\\r\\nI only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses\\r\\nto you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there\\r\\nwould be every possibility of your being happy together.  A most\\r\\nsuitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be\\r\\na very happy one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I\\r\\nthink highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"I own that to\\r\\nbe able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future\\r\\nLady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother\\'s\\r\\nplace, succeeding to all her rights, and all her popularity, as well as\\r\\nto all her virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me.\\r\\nYou are your mother\\'s self in countenance and disposition; and if I\\r\\nmight be allowed to fancy you such as she was, in situation and name,\\r\\nand home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to\\r\\nher in being more highly valued!  My dearest Anne, it would give me\\r\\nmore delight than is often felt at my time of life!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,\\r\\nand, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\\r\\nthis picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart\\r\\nwere bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been; of\\r\\nhaving the precious name of \"Lady Elliot\" first revived in herself; of\\r\\nbeing restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again, her home for\\r\\never, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.  Lady Russell\\r\\nsaid not another word, willing to leave the matter to its own\\r\\noperation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment with\\r\\npropriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short, what Anne\\r\\ndid not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself\\r\\nbrought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch and of \"Lady\\r\\nElliot\" all faded away.  She never could accept him.  And it was not\\r\\nonly that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one; her\\r\\njudgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a\\r\\ncase was against Mr Elliot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied\\r\\nthat she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man, an\\r\\nagreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to\\r\\njudge properly and as a man of principle, this was all clear enough.\\r\\nHe certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix on any one article\\r\\nof moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would have been\\r\\nafraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past, if not the\\r\\npresent.  The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the\\r\\nallusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions not\\r\\nfavourable of what he had been.  She saw that there had been bad\\r\\nhabits; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing; that there had\\r\\nbeen a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he had\\r\\nbeen, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he might\\r\\nnow think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of\\r\\na clever, cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair\\r\\ncharacter?  How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly\\r\\ncleansed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.  There\\r\\nwas never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,\\r\\nat the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided\\r\\nimperfection.  Her early impressions were incurable.  She prized the\\r\\nfrank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.  Warmth\\r\\nand enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could so\\r\\nmuch more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or\\r\\nsaid a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind\\r\\nnever varied, whose tongue never slipped.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers in\\r\\nher father\\'s house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well, stood\\r\\ntoo well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some degree of\\r\\nopenness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was\\r\\nabout, and to hold her in contempt; and yet Mrs Clay found him as\\r\\nagreeable as any body.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend, for she saw\\r\\nnothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine a man more exactly\\r\\nwhat he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter\\r\\nfeeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved\\r\\nAnne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in\\r\\nBath, was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.  She\\r\\nwanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.  It was three\\r\\nweeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew that Henrietta was at\\r\\nhome again; and that Louisa, though considered to be recovering fast,\\r\\nwas still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all very intently one\\r\\nevening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to\\r\\nher; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise, with Admiral and Mrs\\r\\nCroft\\'s compliments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest her.  They were\\r\\npeople whom her heart turned to very naturally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is this?\" cried Sir Walter.  \"The Crofts have arrived in Bath?\\r\\nThe Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an\\r\\nintroduction.  I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any\\r\\nrate.  I know what is due to my tenant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how the poor\\r\\nAdmiral\\'s complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.  It had been\\r\\nbegun several days back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"February 1st.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know how\\r\\nlittle people think of letters in such a place as Bath.  You must be a\\r\\ngreat deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know,\\r\\naffords little to write about.  We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr\\r\\nand Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays.  I do\\r\\nnot reckon the Hayters as anybody.  The holidays, however, are over at\\r\\nlast:  I believe no children ever had such long ones.  I am sure I had\\r\\nnot.  The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles;\\r\\nbut you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home.  Mrs\\r\\nHarville must be an odd mother to part with them so long.  I do not\\r\\nunderstand it.  They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but\\r\\nMrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than her\\r\\ngrandchildren.  What dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt\\r\\nin Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some\\r\\nconsequence.  I have not had a creature call on me since the second\\r\\nweek in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much\\r\\noftener than was welcome.  Between ourselves, I think it a great pity\\r\\nHenrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept\\r\\nher a little out of his way.  The carriage is gone to-day, to bring\\r\\nLouisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.  We are not asked to dine with\\r\\nthem, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her\\r\\nbeing fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, considering\\r\\nthe care that will be taken of her; and it would be much more\\r\\nconvenient to me to dine there to-morrow.  I am glad you find Mr Elliot\\r\\nso agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him too; but I have\\r\\nmy usual luck:  I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is\\r\\ngoing on; always the last of my family to be noticed.  What an immense\\r\\ntime Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to\\r\\ngo away?  But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we might\\r\\nnot be invited.  Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expect\\r\\nmy children to be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House\\r\\nvery well, for a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the\\r\\nCrofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral\\r\\ngouty.  Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the\\r\\ncivility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.  I do\\r\\nnot think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,\\r\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me\\r\\nin love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary M---.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has just\\r\\ntold me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much\\r\\nabout.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, are\\r\\nalways worse than anybody\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an\\r\\nenvelope, containing nearly as much more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa bore her\\r\\njourney, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal to add.\\r\\nIn the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday, offering to\\r\\nconvey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed to\\r\\nme, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as\\r\\nlong as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely\\r\\nhope Bath will do him all the good he wants.  I shall be truly glad to\\r\\nhave them back again.  Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant\\r\\nfamily.  But now for Louisa.  I have something to communicate that will\\r\\nastonish you not a little.  She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very\\r\\nsafely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were\\r\\nrather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had\\r\\nbeen invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the\\r\\nreason?  Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and\\r\\nnot choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr\\r\\nMusgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came\\r\\naway, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.  True, upon\\r\\nmy honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised at least if\\r\\nyou ever received a hint of it, for I never did.  Mrs Musgrove protests\\r\\nsolemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.  We are all very well\\r\\npleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain\\r\\nWentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove\\r\\nhas written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day.  Mrs\\r\\nHarville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister\\'s\\r\\naccount; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both.  Indeed,\\r\\nMrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having\\r\\nnursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if\\r\\nyou remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see\\r\\nanything of it.  And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick\\'s\\r\\nbeing supposed to be an admirer of yours.  How Charles could take such\\r\\na thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me.  I hope he\\r\\nwill be more agreeable now.  Certainly not a great match for Louisa\\r\\nMusgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMary need not have feared her sister\\'s being in any degree prepared for\\r\\nthe news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.  Captain\\r\\nBenwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful for belief,\\r\\nand it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room,\\r\\npreserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions of the\\r\\nmoment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter wanted to\\r\\nknow whether the Crofts travelled with four horses, and whether they\\r\\nwere likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss\\r\\nElliot and himself to visit in; but had little curiosity beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, \"And\\r\\npray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They come on the Admiral\\'s account.  He is thought to be gouty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gout and decrepitude!\" said Sir Walter.  \"Poor old gentleman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have they any acquaintance here?\" asked Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft\\'s time\\r\\nof life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance in\\r\\nsuch a place as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft will be best\\r\\nknown in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.  Elizabeth, may we\\r\\nventure to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,\\r\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she\\r\\nmight not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify; but\\r\\nas cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.  We\\r\\nhad better leave the Crofts to find their own level.  There are several\\r\\nodd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors.  The\\r\\nCrofts will associate with them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\'s share of interest in the letter;\\r\\nwhen Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention, in an\\r\\nenquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys, Anne was\\r\\nat liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder\\r\\nhow Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,\\r\\nhad given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\\r\\nShe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin\\r\\nto ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure that\\r\\nsuch a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited, joyous-talking\\r\\nLouisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking, feeling, reading, Captain\\r\\nBenwick, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other.\\r\\nTheir minds most dissimilar!  Where could have been the attraction?\\r\\nThe answer soon presented itself.  It had been in situation.  They had\\r\\nbeen thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same\\r\\nsmall family party:  since Henrietta\\'s coming away, they must have been\\r\\ndepending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recovering\\r\\nfrom illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was\\r\\nnot inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne had not been able to\\r\\navoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as\\r\\nMary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm\\r\\nthe idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself.\\r\\nShe did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify her\\r\\nvanity, than Mary might have allowed.  She was persuaded that any\\r\\ntolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for\\r\\nhim would have received the same compliment.  He had an affectionate\\r\\nheart.  He must love somebody.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine naval\\r\\nfervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.  He would\\r\\ngain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott\\r\\nand Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course they\\r\\nhad fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned\\r\\ninto a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection was\\r\\namusing, but she had no doubt of its being so.  The day at Lyme, the\\r\\nfall from the Cobb, might influence her health, her nerves, her\\r\\ncourage, her character to the end of her life, as thoroughly as it\\r\\nappeared to have influenced her fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been\\r\\nsensible of Captain Wentworth\\'s merits could be allowed to prefer\\r\\nanother man, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting\\r\\nwonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly\\r\\nnothing to be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne\\'s heart\\r\\nbeat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks when\\r\\nshe thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.  She had some\\r\\nfeelings which she was ashamed to investigate.  They were too much like\\r\\njoy, senseless joy!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was\\r\\nevident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.  The visit of\\r\\nceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned, and\\r\\nCaptain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectly\\r\\nto Sir Walter\\'s satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed of the\\r\\nacquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more about\\r\\nthe Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for, and\\r\\nconsidered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,\\r\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.  They brought\\r\\nwith them their country habit of being almost always together.  He was\\r\\nordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares\\r\\nwith him in everything, and to walk for her life to do him good.  Anne\\r\\nsaw them wherever she went.  Lady Russell took her out in her carriage\\r\\nalmost every morning, and she never failed to think of them, and never\\r\\nfailed to see them.  Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most\\r\\nattractive picture of happiness to her.  She always watched them as\\r\\nlong as she could, delighted to fancy she understood what they might be\\r\\ntalking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equally\\r\\ndelighted to see the Admiral\\'s hearty shake of the hand when he\\r\\nencountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\\r\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft\\r\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking\\r\\nherself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\\r\\nafter the Croft\\'s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend, or\\r\\nher friend\\'s carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone\\r\\nto Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good\\r\\nfortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing by himself at a\\r\\nprintshop window, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplation\\r\\nof some print, and she not only might have passed him unseen, but was\\r\\nobliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his\\r\\nnotice.  When he did perceive and acknowledge her, however, it was done\\r\\nwith all his usual frankness and good humour.  \"Ha! is it you?  Thank\\r\\nyou, thank you.  This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you\\r\\nsee, staring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without\\r\\nstopping.  But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.\\r\\nDid you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must\\r\\nbe, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\r\\nold cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it\\r\\nmightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and\\r\\nmountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they\\r\\ncertainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!\" (laughing\\r\\nheartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it.  Well,\"\\r\\n(turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere for you,\\r\\nor with you?  Can I be of any use?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your\\r\\ncompany the little way our road lies together.  I am going home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes we will\\r\\nhave a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we go\\r\\nalong.  There, take my arm; that\\'s right; I do not feel comfortable if\\r\\nI have not a woman there.  Lord! what a boat it is!\" taking a last look\\r\\nat the picture, as they began to be in motion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I\\r\\nshall only say, \\'How d\\'ye do?\\' as we pass, however.  I shall not stop.\\r\\n\\'How d\\'ye do?\\'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.\\r\\nShe, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of her\\r\\nheels, as large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the\\r\\nstreet, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabby\\r\\nfellows, both of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.\\r\\nSophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once: got away\\r\\nwith some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story another\\r\\ntime.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.  Look, he\\r\\nsees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.  Ah! the\\r\\npeace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!  How\\r\\ndo you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very well.  We are always\\r\\nmeeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every\\r\\nmorning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them\\r\\nall, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and\\r\\nare as snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at\\r\\nNorth Yarmouth and Deal.  We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I\\r\\ncan tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North\\r\\nYarmouth.  The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same\\r\\nway.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again for\\r\\nwhat he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to\\r\\nhave her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait, for\\r\\nthe Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the\\r\\ngreater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was not really Mrs\\r\\nCroft, she must let him have his own way.  As soon as they were fairly\\r\\nascending Belmont, he began--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.  But first\\r\\nof all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk\\r\\nabout.  That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concerned\\r\\nfor.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to.  Her\\r\\nChristian name:  I always forget her Christian name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\r\\ndid; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"Louisa.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies\\r\\nhad not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out\\r\\nif they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well, this Miss\\r\\nLouisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.  He was\\r\\ncourting her week after week.  The only wonder was, what they could be\\r\\nwaiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear\\r\\nenough that they must wait till her brain was set to right.  But even\\r\\nthen there was something odd in their way of going on.  Instead of\\r\\nstaying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to see\\r\\nEdward.  When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward\\'s,\\r\\nand there he has been ever since.  We have seen nothing of him since\\r\\nNovember.  Even Sophy could not understand it.  But now, the matter has\\r\\ntaken the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss\\r\\nMusgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James\\r\\nBenwick.  You know James Benwick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they are married already,\\r\\nfor I do not know what they should wait for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said Anne, \"and\\r\\nI understand that he bears an excellent character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.\\r\\nHe is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad\\r\\ntimes for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.  An\\r\\nexcellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous\\r\\nofficer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that\\r\\nsoft sort of manner does not do him justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of\\r\\nspirit from Captain Benwick\\'s manners.  I thought them particularly\\r\\npleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather\\r\\ntoo piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,\\r\\nSophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick\\'s manners better than his.\\r\\nThere is something about Frederick more to our taste.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of\\r\\nspirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all to\\r\\nrepresent Captain Benwick\\'s manners as the very best that could\\r\\npossibly be; and, after a little hesitation, she was beginning to say,\\r\\n\"I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends,\" but the\\r\\nAdmiral interrupted her with--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.  We\\r\\nhave it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter from him\\r\\nyesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it in a\\r\\nletter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.  I fancy\\r\\nthey are all at Uppercross.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said,\\r\\ntherefore, \"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly\\r\\nuneasy.  It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment\\r\\nbetween him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to\\r\\nhave worn out on each side equally, and without violence.  I hope his\\r\\nletter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from\\r\\nbeginning to end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne looked down to hide her smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too much\\r\\nspirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit\\r\\nshe should have him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing in\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks\\r\\nhimself ill-used by his friend, which might appear, you know, without\\r\\nits being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry that such a\\r\\nfriendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be\\r\\ndestroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of that\\r\\nnature in the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;\\r\\ndoes not so much as say, \\'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for\\r\\nwondering at it.\\'  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,\\r\\nthat he had ever thought of this Miss (what\\'s her name?) for himself.\\r\\nHe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is\\r\\nnothing very unforgiving in that, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to\\r\\nconvey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.\\r\\nShe therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet\\r\\nattention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Frederick!\" said he at last.  \"Now he must begin all over again\\r\\nwith somebody else.  I think we must get him to Bath.  Sophy must\\r\\nwrite, and beg him to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am\\r\\nsure.  It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other\\r\\nMiss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.  Do\\r\\nnot you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing his\\r\\nwish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth was\\r\\nalready on his way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written, he was\\r\\narrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were in\\r\\nMilsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to make shelter\\r\\ndesirable for women, and quite enough to make it very desirable for\\r\\nMiss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady\\r\\nDalrymple\\'s carriage, which was seen waiting at a little distance; she,\\r\\nAnne, and Mrs Clay, therefore, turned into Molland\\'s, while Mr Elliot\\r\\nstepped to Lady Dalrymple, to request her assistance.  He soon joined\\r\\nthem again, successful, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy\\r\\nto take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer ladyship\\'s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold more than four\\r\\nwith any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother; consequently it\\r\\nwas not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden\\r\\nPlace ladies.  There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot.  Whoever\\r\\nsuffered inconvenience, she must suffer none, but it occupied a little\\r\\ntime to settle the point of civility between the other two.  The rain\\r\\nwas a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with\\r\\nMr Elliot.  But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would\\r\\nhardly allow it even to drop at all, and her boots were so thick! much\\r\\nthicker than Miss Anne\\'s; and, in short, her civility rendered her\\r\\nquite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be,\\r\\nand it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so\\r\\ndetermined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss\\r\\nElliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already, and Mr\\r\\nElliot deciding on appeal, that his cousin Anne\\'s boots were rather the\\r\\nthickest.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the\\r\\ncarriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne, as she sat\\r\\nnear the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, Captain\\r\\nWentworth walking down the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that\\r\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable and\\r\\nabsurd!  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her; it was all\\r\\nconfusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded back her senses, she\\r\\nfound the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliot (always\\r\\nobliging) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs\\r\\nClay\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; she wanted to\\r\\nsee if it rained.  Why was she to suspect herself of another motive?\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth must be out of sight.  She left her seat, she would\\r\\ngo; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other\\r\\nhalf, or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was.  She\\r\\nwould see if it rained.  She was sent back, however, in a moment by the\\r\\nentrance of Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and\\r\\nladies, evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined a\\r\\nlittle below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck and confused\\r\\nby the sight of her than she had ever observed before; he looked quite\\r\\nred.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she felt\\r\\nthat she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.  She had the\\r\\nadvantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.  All the\\r\\noverpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise\\r\\nwere over with her.  Still, however, she had enough to feel!  It was\\r\\nagitation, pain, pleasure, a something between delight and misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke to her, and then turned away.  The character of his manner was\\r\\nembarrassment.  She could not have called it either cold or friendly,\\r\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.\\r\\nMutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,\\r\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible\\r\\nof his being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being so\\r\\nvery much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable\\r\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it\\r\\nnow.  Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.  There was\\r\\nconsciousness of some sort or other.  He looked very well, not as if he\\r\\nhad been suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,\\r\\nof the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look of\\r\\nhis own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was Captain\\r\\nWentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth\\r\\nwould not know him.  She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw\\r\\nhim, that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she was\\r\\nconvinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,\\r\\nexpecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with\\r\\nunalterable coldness.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing very\\r\\nimpatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.  It was\\r\\nbeginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay, and a\\r\\nbustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd in the shop\\r\\nunderstand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot.  At\\r\\nlast Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but by the servant, (for\\r\\nthere was no cousin returned), were walking off; and Captain Wentworth,\\r\\nwatching them, turned again to Anne, and by manner, rather than words,\\r\\nwas offering his services to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with\\r\\nthem.  The carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I prefer\\r\\nwalking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it rains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause he said:  \"Though I came only yesterday, I have\\r\\nequipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,\" (pointing to a new\\r\\numbrella); \"I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to\\r\\nwalk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a\\r\\nchair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating her\\r\\nconviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present, and adding,\\r\\n\"I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.  He will be here in a moment, I am\\r\\nsure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.  Captain\\r\\nWentworth recollected him perfectly.  There was no difference between\\r\\nhim and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anne as\\r\\nshe passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privileged\\r\\nrelation and friend.  He came in with eagerness, appeared to see and\\r\\nthink only of her, apologised for his stay, was grieved to have kept\\r\\nher waiting, and anxious to get her away without further loss of time\\r\\nand before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked off\\r\\ntogether, her arm under his, a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a\\r\\n\"Good morning to you!\" being all that she had time for, as she passed\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth\\'s\\r\\nparty began talking of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.\\r\\nHe is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.  What a\\r\\nvery good-looking man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises, says\\r\\nhe is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes to\\r\\nlook at her.  It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admire\\r\\nher more than her sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! so do I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss\\r\\nElliot.  Anne is too delicate for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would\\r\\nhave walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a\\r\\nword.  She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though\\r\\nnothing could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects\\r\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting: praise,\\r\\nwarm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell, and insinuations\\r\\nhighly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now she could think only of\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth.  She could not understand his present feelings,\\r\\nwhether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not; and\\r\\ntill that point were settled, she could not be quite herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!  she must\\r\\nconfess to herself that she was not wise yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long he\\r\\nmeant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not\\r\\nrecollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more\\r\\nprobable that he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as\\r\\nevery body was to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all\\r\\nlikelihood see him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would it\\r\\nall be?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove\\r\\nwas to marry Captain Benwick.  It had cost her something to encounter\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance to be\\r\\nthrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge of\\r\\nthe matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first\\r\\nhour, in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at\\r\\nlast, in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him on the\\r\\nright hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the\\r\\ngreater part of the street.  There were many other men about him, many\\r\\ngroups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.  She\\r\\nlooked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea of her\\r\\nrecognising him so soon as she did herself.  No, it was not to be\\r\\nsupposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly\\r\\nopposite.  She looked at her however, from time to time, anxiously; and\\r\\nwhen the moment approached which must point him out, though not daring\\r\\nto look again (for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen),\\r\\nshe was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell\\'s eyes being turned\\r\\nexactly in the direction for him--of her being, in short, intently\\r\\nobserving him.  She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination\\r\\nhe must possess over Lady Russell\\'s mind, the difficulty it must be for\\r\\nher to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment she must be feeling that\\r\\neight or nine years should have passed over him, and in foreign climes\\r\\nand in active service too, without robbing him of one personal grace!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, Lady Russell drew back her head.  \"Now, how would she speak of\\r\\nhim?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long; but\\r\\nI was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs\\r\\nFrankland were telling me of last night.  They described the\\r\\ndrawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the\\r\\nway, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung\\r\\nof any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have\\r\\nbeen trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no\\r\\ncurtains hereabouts that answer their description.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her\\r\\nfriend or herself.  The part which provoked her most, was that in all\\r\\nthis waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the right\\r\\nmoment for seeing whether he saw them.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the\\r\\nrooms, where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for\\r\\nthe Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant\\r\\nstupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and more\\r\\nengaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of\\r\\nknowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her strength was\\r\\nnot tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.  It was a\\r\\nconcert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.  Of\\r\\ncourse they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one, and\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have a few\\r\\nminutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should be\\r\\nsatisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over\\r\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred.  Elizabeth had turned from him,\\r\\nLady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened by these\\r\\ncircumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;\\r\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off, with\\r\\nthe more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.  Mrs Smith\\r\\ngave a most good-humoured acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come.\\r\\nWho is your party?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was leaving\\r\\nher said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, \"Well, I\\r\\nheartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if\\r\\nyou can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many\\r\\nmore visits from you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment\\'s\\r\\nsuspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest of all\\r\\ntheir party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple must be\\r\\nwaited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon\\r\\nRoom.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was the nearest to him, and\\r\\nmaking yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.  He was preparing\\r\\nonly to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"How do you do?\" brought him\\r\\nout of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries in\\r\\nreturn, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back\\r\\nground.  Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew\\r\\nnothing of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed\\r\\nright to be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth\\r\\ncaught her ear.  She could not distinguish, but she must guess the\\r\\nsubject; and on Captain Wentworth\\'s making a distant bow, she\\r\\ncomprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that\\r\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time by a\\r\\nside glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.  This,\\r\\nthough late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better than\\r\\nnothing, and her spirits improved.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,\\r\\ntheir conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, that\\r\\nshe was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not; he seemed in\\r\\nno hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit, with a little\\r\\nsmile, a little glow, he said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must\\r\\nhave suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering\\r\\nyou at the time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe assured him that she had not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he passed\\r\\nhis hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still too painful,\\r\\nbut in a moment, half smiling again, added, \"The day has produced some\\r\\neffects however; has had some consequences which must be considered as\\r\\nthe very reverse of frightful.  When you had the presence of mind to\\r\\nsuggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon,\\r\\nyou could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most\\r\\nconcerned in her recovery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would\\r\\nbe a very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles and\\r\\ngood temper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, I think, ends\\r\\nthe resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over\\r\\nevery circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties to\\r\\ncontend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.  The\\r\\nMusgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,\\r\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter\\'s\\r\\ncomfort.  All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;\\r\\nmore than perhaps--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him\\r\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne\\'s cheeks and fixing\\r\\nher eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however, he\\r\\nproceeded thus--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,\\r\\nand in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove\\r\\nas a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in\\r\\nunderstanding, but Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a\\r\\nreading man; and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to\\r\\nher with some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he\\r\\nlearnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, it\\r\\nwould have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.\\r\\nIt seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\\r\\nuntaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,\\r\\nin his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!  Fanny\\r\\nHarville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her was\\r\\nindeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such a devotion of the\\r\\nheart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEither from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,\\r\\nor from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who, in spite\\r\\nof the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered, and in\\r\\nspite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless slam\\r\\nof the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through, had\\r\\ndistinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused, and\\r\\nbeginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things in a\\r\\nmoment.  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject; and yet,\\r\\nafter a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not the\\r\\nsmallest wish for a total change, she only deviated so far as to say--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa\\'s doing well was\\r\\nquite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to\\r\\nbe soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.  She would not\\r\\nhave been obstinate if I had not been weak.  The country round Lyme is\\r\\nvery fine.  I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, the\\r\\nmore I found to admire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should very much like to see Lyme again,\" said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found anything\\r\\nin Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress you were\\r\\ninvolved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!  I should have\\r\\nthought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied Anne; \"but when\\r\\npain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.  One does\\r\\nnot love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been\\r\\nall suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at\\r\\nLyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours,\\r\\nand previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment.  So much\\r\\nnovelty and beauty! I have travelled so little, that every fresh place\\r\\nwould be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in\\r\\nshort\" (with a faint blush at some recollections), \"altogether my\\r\\nimpressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party\\r\\nappeared for whom they were waiting.  \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\"\\r\\nwas the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with\\r\\nanxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet\\r\\nher.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot and\\r\\nColonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\\r\\nadvanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was a group in\\r\\nwhich Anne found herself also necessarily included.  She was divided\\r\\nfrom Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting, almost too interesting\\r\\nconversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penance\\r\\ncompared with the happiness which brought it on!  She had learnt, in\\r\\nthe last ten minutes, more of his feelings towards Louisa, more of all\\r\\nhis feelings than she dared to think of; and she gave herself up to the\\r\\ndemands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, with\\r\\nexquisite, though agitated sensations.  She was in good humour with\\r\\nall.  She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and\\r\\nkind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\\r\\nfrom the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw that\\r\\nhe was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert\\r\\nRoom.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt a moment\\'s regret.\\r\\nBut \"they should meet again.  He would look for her, he would find her\\r\\nout before the evening were over, and at present, perhaps, it was as\\r\\nwell to be asunder.  She was in need of a little interval for\\r\\nrecollection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon Lady Russell\\'s appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was\\r\\ncollected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed\\r\\ninto the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power,\\r\\ndraw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people\\r\\nas they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.\\r\\nElizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back\\r\\nof the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish\\r\\nfor which did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be an\\r\\ninsult to the nature of Anne\\'s felicity, to draw any comparison between\\r\\nit and her sister\\'s; the origin of one all selfish vanity, of the other\\r\\nall generous attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.  Her\\r\\nhappiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\\r\\nbut she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of the last half\\r\\nhour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took a hasty range\\r\\nover it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions, and still more his\\r\\nmanner and look, had been such as she could see in only one light.  His\\r\\nopinion of Louisa Musgrove\\'s inferiority, an opinion which he had\\r\\nseemed solicitous to give, his wonder at Captain Benwick, his feelings\\r\\nas to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he could not\\r\\nfinish, his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance,\\r\\nall, all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least; that\\r\\nanger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were\\r\\nsucceeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness\\r\\nof the past.  Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past.  She could\\r\\nnot contemplate the change as implying less.  He must love her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied and\\r\\nflurried her too much to leave her any power of observation; and she\\r\\npassed along the room without having a glimpse of him, without even\\r\\ntrying to discern him.  When their places were determined on, and they\\r\\nwere all properly arranged, she looked round to see if he should happen\\r\\nto be in the same part of the room, but he was not; her eye could not\\r\\nreach him; and the concert being just opening, she must consent for a\\r\\ntime to be happy in a humbler way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches: Anne\\r\\nwas among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,\\r\\nwith the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by\\r\\nher.  Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\\r\\nof Colonel Wallis\\'s gallantry, was quite contented.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne\\'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the\\r\\nevening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for the\\r\\ntender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience\\r\\nfor the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least\\r\\nduring the first act.  Towards the close of it, in the interval\\r\\nsucceeding an Italian song, she explained the words of the song to Mr\\r\\nElliot.  They had a concert bill between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the\\r\\nwords, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be\\r\\ntalked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not\\r\\npretend to understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.  You\\r\\nhave only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these\\r\\ninverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,\\r\\ncomprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more of\\r\\nyour ignorance.  Here is complete proof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be\\r\\nexamined by a real proficient.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,\"\\r\\nreplied he, \"without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot; and I do\\r\\nregard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be\\r\\naware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished for\\r\\nmodesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are\\r\\nto have next,\" turning to the bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, \"I have had a longer\\r\\nacquaintance with your character than you are aware of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since I\\r\\ncame to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my\\r\\nown family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you\\r\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted\\r\\nwith you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,\\r\\naccomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.  No\\r\\none can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been described\\r\\nlong ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible;\\r\\nand Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered, and questioned him eagerly;\\r\\nbut in vain.  He delighted in being asked, but he would not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He would mention no\\r\\nnames now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.  He had\\r\\nmany years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had\\r\\ninspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited the\\r\\nwarmest curiosity to know her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of\\r\\nher many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth\\'s\\r\\nbrother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot\\'s company, but she had not\\r\\ncourage to ask the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound\\r\\nto me.  Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I\\r\\ndared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she received their\\r\\nsound, than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind\\r\\nher, which rendered every thing else trivial.  Her father and Lady\\r\\nDalrymple were speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A well-looking man,\" said Sir Walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple.  \"More air than\\r\\none often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth; Captain\\r\\nWentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire,\\r\\nthe Croft, who rents Kellynch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne\\'s eyes had caught the\\r\\nright direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a\\r\\ncluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him, his\\r\\nseemed to be withdrawn from her.  It had that appearance.  It seemed as\\r\\nif she had been one moment too late; and as long as she dared observe,\\r\\nhe did not look again:  but the performance was recommencing, and she\\r\\nwas forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look\\r\\nstraight forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she could give another glance, he had moved away.  He could not\\r\\nhave come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\\r\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Elliot\\'s speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer any\\r\\ninclination to talk to him.  She wished him not so near her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first act was over.  Now she hoped for some beneficial change; and,\\r\\nafter a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them did\\r\\ndecide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who did not\\r\\nchoose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell; but\\r\\nshe had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,\\r\\nwhatever she might feel on Lady Russell\\'s account, to shrink from\\r\\nconversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\\r\\nShe was persuaded by Lady Russell\\'s countenance that she had seen him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a\\r\\ndistance, but he never came.  The anxious interval wore away\\r\\nunproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again, benches\\r\\nwere reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or of\\r\\npenance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight or\\r\\nthe gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.  To Anne, it\\r\\nchiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.  She could not quit\\r\\nthat room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, without\\r\\nthe interchange of one friendly look.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of\\r\\nwhich was favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down\\r\\nagain, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a\\r\\nmanner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other\\r\\nremovals, and a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place\\r\\nherself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before, much\\r\\nmore within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so, without\\r\\ncomparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but\\r\\nstill she did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what\\r\\nseemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next\\r\\nneighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench before the\\r\\nconcert closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain\\r\\nWentworth was again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw her\\r\\ntoo; yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow\\r\\ndegrees came at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that\\r\\nsomething must be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The\\r\\ndifference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon\\r\\nRoom was strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father, of\\r\\nLady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?  He began\\r\\nby speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of\\r\\nUppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in\\r\\nshort, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.  Anne\\r\\nreplied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in\\r\\nallowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\\r\\nimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked for a\\r\\nfew minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards the\\r\\nbench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that\\r\\nmoment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.  It came\\r\\nfrom Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, to\\r\\nexplain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a\\r\\ngeneral idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse; but\\r\\nnever had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and\\r\\nwhen her own mistress again, when able to turn and look as she had done\\r\\nbefore, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved\\r\\nyet hurried sort of farewell.  \"He must wish her good night; he was\\r\\ngoing; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck by an\\r\\nidea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\\r\\nand he was gone directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nJealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.  Captain\\r\\nWentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it a week\\r\\nago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.\\r\\nBut, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.  How was such\\r\\njealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?  How, in all\\r\\nthe peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations, would he\\r\\never learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think of Mr\\r\\nElliot\\'s attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to\\r\\nMrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when\\r\\nMr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid Mr Elliot was\\r\\nalmost a first object.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of the\\r\\nmischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard, perhaps\\r\\ncompassion.  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\r\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which he\\r\\nseemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation, by his own\\r\\nsentiments, by his early prepossession.  It was altogether very\\r\\nextraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.  How\\r\\nshe might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,\\r\\nwas not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the\\r\\nconclusion of the present suspense good or bad, her affection would be\\r\\nhis for ever.  Their union, she believed, could not divide her more\\r\\nfrom other men, than their final separation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, could\\r\\nnever have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sporting\\r\\nwith from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.  It was almost enough to\\r\\nspread purification and perfume all the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this\\r\\nmorning particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have\\r\\nexpected her, though it had been an appointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne\\'s\\r\\nrecollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her\\r\\nfeatures and make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tell\\r\\nshe told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been\\r\\nthere, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had\\r\\nalready heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,\\r\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne\\r\\ncould relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the\\r\\ncompany.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well\\r\\nknow by name to Mrs Smith.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The little Durands were there, I conclude,\" said she, \"with their\\r\\nmouths open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be\\r\\nfed.  They never miss a concert.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in\\r\\nthe room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties, with the\\r\\ntall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  I do not think they were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses, I\\r\\nknow; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your own\\r\\ncircle; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of\\r\\ngrandeur, round the orchestra, of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me\\r\\nin every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be\\r\\nfarther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing;\\r\\nI must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.  There\\r\\nis a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this\\r\\nyou had.  You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing\\r\\nbeyond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious while\\r\\nshe spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that\\r\\nthe object only had been deficient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you had a\\r\\npleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see how the hours\\r\\npassed:  that you had always something agreeable to listen to.  In the\\r\\nintervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne half smiled and said, \"Do you see that in my eye?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in\\r\\ncompany last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in\\r\\nthe world, the person who interests you at this present time more than\\r\\nall the rest of the world put together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA blush overspread Anne\\'s cheeks.  She could say nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause, \"I\\r\\nhope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to\\r\\nme this morning.  It is really very good of you to come and sit with\\r\\nme, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and\\r\\nconfusion excited by her friend\\'s penetration, unable to imagine how\\r\\nany report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.  After another\\r\\nshort silence--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with\\r\\nme?  Does he know that I am in Bath?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment\\'s\\r\\nreflection shewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it\\r\\ninstantaneously; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety,\\r\\nsoon added, more composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith,\\r\\ngravely, \"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.  Had I\\r\\nknown it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To confess the truth,\" said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual air of\\r\\ncheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.  I want\\r\\nyou to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him.  He\\r\\ncan be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\\r\\nmy dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself, of course it is\\r\\ndone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to\\r\\nbe of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect that\\r\\nyou are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot, a greater\\r\\nright to influence him, than is really the case.  I am sure you have,\\r\\nsomehow or other, imbibed such a notion.  You must consider me only as\\r\\nMr Elliot\\'s relation.  If in that light there is anything which you\\r\\nsuppose his cousin might fairly ask of him, I beg you would not\\r\\nhesitate to employ me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.  I\\r\\nought to have waited for official information.  But now, my dear Miss\\r\\nElliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.\\r\\nNext week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all\\r\\nsettled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot\\'s good fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.  I assure you\\r\\nthat nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week.\\r\\nI am not going to marry Mr Elliot.  I should like to know why you\\r\\nimagine I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook her\\r\\nhead, and exclaimed--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew what you\\r\\nwere at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when\\r\\nthe right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know, we women never\\r\\nmean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us, that every man\\r\\nis refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?  Let me plead\\r\\nfor my--present friend I cannot call him, but for my former friend.\\r\\nWhere can you look for a more suitable match?  Where could you expect a\\r\\nmore gentlemanlike, agreeable man?  Let me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am\\r\\nsure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis; and who can\\r\\nknow him better than Colonel Wallis?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot\\'s wife has not been dead much above half\\r\\na year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any\\r\\none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly, \"Mr\\r\\nElliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.  Do\\r\\nnot forget me when you are married, that\\'s all.  Let him know me to be\\r\\na friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble\\r\\nrequired, which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs\\r\\nand engagements of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very\\r\\nnatural, perhaps.  Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of\\r\\ncourse, he cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss\\r\\nElliot, I hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense\\r\\nto understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be\\r\\nshipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters, and\\r\\nsafe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be\\r\\nmisled by others to his ruin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"I can readily believe all that of my cousin.  He\\r\\nseems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous\\r\\nimpressions.  I consider him with great respect.  I have no reason,\\r\\nfrom any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise.\\r\\nBut I have not known him long; and he is not a man, I think, to be\\r\\nknown intimately soon.  Will not this manner of speaking of him, Mrs\\r\\nSmith, convince you that he is nothing to me?  Surely this must be calm\\r\\nenough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.  Should he ever\\r\\npropose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine he has any\\r\\nthought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you I shall not.\\r\\nI assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been\\r\\nsupposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford:\\r\\nnot Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\\r\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly\\r\\nhave believed so soon in Mr Elliot\\'s failure, but from the perception\\r\\nof there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,\\r\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to\\r\\nescape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have\\r\\nfancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have received the\\r\\nidea, or from whom she could have heard it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It first came into my head,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"upon finding how much\\r\\nyou were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the\\r\\nworld to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you\\r\\nmay depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in\\r\\nthe same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And has it indeed been spoken of?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called\\r\\nyesterday?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed no one\\r\\nin particular.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a great\\r\\ncuriosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in.\\r\\nShe came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she it was\\r\\nwho told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.  She had had it from Mrs\\r\\nWallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.  She sat an hour with\\r\\nme on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\" \"The whole\\r\\nhistory,\" repeated Anne, laughing.  \"She could not make a very long\\r\\nhistory, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Smith said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my\\r\\nhaving this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of\\r\\nuse to you in any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being\\r\\nin Bath?  Shall I take any message?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment, and\\r\\nunder a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to\\r\\ninterest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you, I\\r\\nhave nothing to trouble you with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not before he was married, I suppose?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And--were you much acquainted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Intimately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.  I have a\\r\\ngreat curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.  Was he\\r\\nat all such as he appears now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s answer,\\r\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\\r\\nand Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\\r\\nThey were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her natural\\r\\ntone of cordiality, \"I beg your pardon for the short answers I have\\r\\nbeen giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.  I have\\r\\nbeen doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.  There\\r\\nwere many things to be taken into the account.  One hates to be\\r\\nofficious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.  Even the\\r\\nsmooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there may\\r\\nbe nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined; I think I am\\r\\nright; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot\\'s real\\r\\ncharacter.  Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the\\r\\nsmallest intention of accepting him, there is no saying what may\\r\\nhappen.  You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards\\r\\nhim.  Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr\\r\\nElliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary,\\r\\ncold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own\\r\\ninterest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery,\\r\\nthat could be perpetrated without risk of his general character.  He\\r\\nhas no feeling for others.  Those whom he has been the chief cause of\\r\\nleading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallest\\r\\ncompunction.  He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of\\r\\njustice or compassion.  Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne\\'s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause, and\\r\\nin a calmer manner, she added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry\\r\\nwoman.  But I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.  I\\r\\nwill only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.  He was\\r\\nthe intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and\\r\\nthought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed before\\r\\nour marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became\\r\\nexcessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion\\r\\nof him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but\\r\\nMr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more\\r\\nagreeable than most others, and we were almost always together.  We\\r\\nwere principally in town, living in very good style.  He was then the\\r\\ninferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in\\r\\nthe Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance\\r\\nof a gentleman.  He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he\\r\\nwas always welcome; he was like a brother.  My poor Charles, who had\\r\\nthe finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his\\r\\nlast farthing with him; and I know that his purse was open to him; I\\r\\nknow that he often assisted him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot\\'s life,\" said\\r\\nAnne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.  It must have\\r\\nbeen about the same time that he became known to my father and sister.\\r\\nI never knew him myself; I only heard of him; but there was a something\\r\\nin his conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and\\r\\nafterwards in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could\\r\\nquite reconcile with present times.  It seemed to announce a different\\r\\nsort of man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know it all, I know it all,\" cried Mrs Smith.  \"He had been\\r\\nintroduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with\\r\\nhim, but I heard him speak of them for ever.  I know he was invited and\\r\\nencouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,\\r\\nperhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his\\r\\nmarriage, I knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors\\r\\nand againsts; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans;\\r\\nand though I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation\\r\\nin society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her\\r\\nlife afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of her\\r\\nlife, and can answer any question you may wish to put.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her.  I\\r\\nhave always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should like\\r\\nto know why, at that time of his life, he should slight my father\\'s\\r\\nacquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed to take very\\r\\nkind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life, had one\\r\\nobject in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker process\\r\\nthan the law.  He was determined to make it by marriage.  He was\\r\\ndetermined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I\\r\\nknow it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannot\\r\\ndecide), that your father and sister, in their civilities and\\r\\ninvitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young\\r\\nlady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his\\r\\nideas of wealth and independence.  That was his motive for drawing\\r\\nback, I can assure you.  He told me the whole story.  He had no\\r\\nconcealments with me.  It was curious, that having just left you behind\\r\\nme in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be\\r\\nyour cousin; and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of\\r\\nyour father and sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought\\r\\nvery affectionately of the other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes spoke of\\r\\nme to Mr Elliot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,\\r\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe checked herself just in time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\" cried\\r\\nAnne.  \"This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.  I\\r\\ncould not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where dear\\r\\nself is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon; I\\r\\nhave interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?\\r\\nThe circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to his\\r\\ncharacter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Smith hesitated a little here.  \"Oh! those things are too common.\\r\\nWhen one lives in the world, a man or woman\\'s marrying for money is too\\r\\ncommon to strike one as it ought.  I was very young, and associated\\r\\nonly with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any\\r\\nstrict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.  I think differently\\r\\nnow; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at\\r\\nthat period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot\\r\\nwas doing.  \\'To do the best for himself,\\' passed as a duty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But was not she a very low woman?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money, was\\r\\nall that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather had been\\r\\na butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman, had had a\\r\\ndecent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance\\r\\ninto Mr Elliot\\'s company, and fell in love with him; and not a\\r\\ndifficulty or a scruple was there on his side, with respect to her\\r\\nbirth.  All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount\\r\\nof her fortune, before he committed himself.  Depend upon it, whatever\\r\\nesteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young\\r\\nman he had not the smallest value for it.  His chance for the Kellynch\\r\\nestate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap\\r\\nas dirt.  I have often heard him declare, that if baronetcies were\\r\\nsaleable, anybody should have his for fifty pounds, arms and motto,\\r\\nname and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I\\r\\nused to hear him say on that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet\\r\\nyou ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you\\r\\nshall have proof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne.  \"You have\\r\\nasserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some\\r\\nyears ago.  This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to\\r\\nhear and believe.  I am more curious to know why he should be so\\r\\ndifferent now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for\\r\\nMary; stay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\r\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\\r\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was\\r\\ndesired.  The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith,\\r\\nsighing over it as she unlocked it, said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband; a small\\r\\nportion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.  The letter I\\r\\nam looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage,\\r\\nand happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.  But he was\\r\\ncareless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and when\\r\\nI came to examine his papers, I found it with others still more\\r\\ntrivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many\\r\\nletters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.  Here it\\r\\nis; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfied\\r\\nwith Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document of former\\r\\nintimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\"\\r\\nand dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers\\r\\nme.  I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I\\r\\nhave lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like\\r\\nit.  At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in\\r\\ncash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.  They\\r\\nare gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them this\\r\\nsummer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell\\r\\nme how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.  The baronet,\\r\\nnevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough.\\r\\nIf he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent\\r\\nequivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse than last year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name of\\r\\nWalter I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me\\r\\nwith my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only\\r\\nyours truly,--Wm. Elliot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and Mrs\\r\\nSmith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot\\r\\nthe exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\\r\\nBut it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.\\r\\nCan any thing be stronger?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of\\r\\nfinding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect\\r\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, that\\r\\nno one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that no\\r\\nprivate correspondence could bear the eye of others, before she could\\r\\nrecover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been\\r\\nmeditating over, and say--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing you\\r\\nwere saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you really?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago, and I\\r\\nwill shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again, but\\r\\nI can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he is\\r\\nnow wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.  He\\r\\ntruly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family are\\r\\nvery sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority: his\\r\\nfriend Colonel Wallis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it\\r\\ntakes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream is as good\\r\\nas at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily\\r\\nmoved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his\\r\\nviews on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, a\\r\\nsensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis has\\r\\na very pretty silly wife, to whom he tells things which he had better\\r\\nnot, and he repeats it all to her.  She in the overflowing spirits of\\r\\nher recovery, repeats it all to her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my\\r\\nacquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday\\r\\nevening, my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of\\r\\nMarlborough Buildings.  When I talked of a whole history, therefore,\\r\\nyou see I was not romancing so much as you supposed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.  Mr\\r\\nElliot\\'s having any views on me will not in the least account for the\\r\\nefforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.  That was all\\r\\nprior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on the most friendly terms\\r\\nwhen I arrived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information in such\\r\\na line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so\\r\\nmany, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can\\r\\nhardly have much truth left.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of the general\\r\\ncredit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself\\r\\nimmediately contradict or confirm.  Nobody supposes that you were his\\r\\nfirst inducement.  He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, and\\r\\nadmired you, but without knowing it to be you.  So says my historian,\\r\\nat least.  Is this true?  Did he see you last summer or autumn,\\r\\n\\'somewhere down in the west,\\' to use her own words, without knowing it\\r\\nto be you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.  I happened to be\\r\\nat Lyme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\\r\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then\\r\\nat Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet\\r\\nwith you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that\\r\\nmoment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there.  But\\r\\nthere was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain.  If there\\r\\nis anything in my story which you know to be either false or\\r\\nimprobable, stop me.  My account states, that your sister\\'s friend, the\\r\\nlady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath\\r\\nwith Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when\\r\\nthey first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since;\\r\\nthat she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible,\\r\\nand altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea,\\r\\namong Sir Walter\\'s acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and\\r\\nas general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to\\r\\nthe danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say, and she\\r\\ncontinued--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\\r\\nlong before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon\\r\\nyour father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit\\r\\nin Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in\\r\\nwatching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath\\r\\nfor a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,\\r\\nColonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and\\r\\nthe reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand, that time\\r\\nhad worked a very material change in Mr Elliot\\'s opinions as to the\\r\\nvalue of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a\\r\\ncompletely altered man.  Having long had as much money as he could\\r\\nspend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has\\r\\nbeen gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is\\r\\nheir to.  I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it\\r\\nis now a confirmed feeling.  He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir\\r\\nWilliam.  You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his\\r\\nfriend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced;\\r\\nthe resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of\\r\\nfixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former\\r\\nacquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give\\r\\nhim the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of\\r\\ncircumventing the lady if he found it material.  This was agreed upon\\r\\nbetween the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel\\r\\nWallis was to assist in every way that he could.  He was to be\\r\\nintroduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to\\r\\nbe introduced.  Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was\\r\\nforgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it\\r\\nwas his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added\\r\\nanother motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.  He omitted no\\r\\nopportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at\\r\\nall hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.  You can\\r\\nimagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may\\r\\nrecollect what you have seen him do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with what\\r\\nI have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive in\\r\\nthe details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\r\\nmust ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises\\r\\nme.  I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr\\r\\nElliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never\\r\\nbeen satisfied.  I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct\\r\\nthan appeared.  I should like to know his present opinion, as to the\\r\\nprobability of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers\\r\\nthe danger to be lessening or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lessening, I understand,\" replied Mrs Smith.  \"He thinks Mrs Clay\\r\\nafraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to\\r\\nproceed as she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent\\r\\nsome time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while\\r\\nshe holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as\\r\\nnurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when\\r\\nyou and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.  A\\r\\nscheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis\\'s understanding, by all accounts; but my\\r\\nsensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  \\'Why, to be sure,\\r\\nma\\'am,\\' said she, \\'it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.\\'\\r\\nAnd, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a\\r\\nvery strenuous opposer of Sir Walter\\'s making a second match.  She must\\r\\nbe allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self\\r\\nwill intrude) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of\\r\\nattending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs Wallis\\'s recommendation?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad to know all this,\" said Anne, after a little\\r\\nthoughtfulness.  \"It will be more painful to me in some respects to be\\r\\nin company with him, but I shall know better what to do.  My line of\\r\\nconduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous,\\r\\nartificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to\\r\\nguide him than selfishness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away from\\r\\nher first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest of her own\\r\\nfamily concerns, how much had been originally implied against him; but\\r\\nher attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints,\\r\\nand she listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify\\r\\nthe unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith, proved him to have been very\\r\\nunfeeling in his conduct towards her; very deficient both in justice\\r\\nand compassion.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr\\r\\nElliot\\'s marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr\\r\\nElliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.  Mrs\\r\\nSmith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender of\\r\\nthrowing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income\\r\\nhad never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\\r\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.  From\\r\\nhis wife\\'s account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man\\r\\nof warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\\r\\nunderstanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\\r\\nled by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by his\\r\\nmarriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of\\r\\npleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\\r\\n(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), and\\r\\nbeginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself to\\r\\nbe poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend\\'s\\r\\nprobable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\\r\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths\\r\\naccordingly had been ruined.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of\\r\\nit.  They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the\\r\\nfriendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot\\'s had better\\r\\nnot be tried; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of\\r\\nhis affairs was fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot\\'s regard,\\r\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had\\r\\nappointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,\\r\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\\r\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been\\r\\nsuch as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\\r\\nwithout corresponding indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to urgent\\r\\napplications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same stern\\r\\nresolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold\\r\\ncivility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it\\r\\nmight bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and\\r\\ninhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime\\r\\ncould have been worse.  She had a great deal to listen to; all the\\r\\nparticulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon\\r\\ndistress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were\\r\\ndwelt on now with a natural indulgence.  Anne could perfectly\\r\\ncomprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to\\r\\nwonder at the composure of her friend\\'s usual state of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of\\r\\nparticular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that some\\r\\nproperty of her husband in the West Indies, which had been for many\\r\\nyears under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own\\r\\nincumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this\\r\\nproperty, though not large, would be enough to make her comparatively\\r\\nrich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.  Mr Elliot would do nothing,\\r\\nand she could do nothing herself, equally disabled from personal\\r\\nexertion by her state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by\\r\\nher want of money.  She had no natural connexions to assist her even\\r\\nwith their counsel, and she could not afford to purchase the assistance\\r\\nof the law.  This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\\r\\nTo feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a little\\r\\ntrouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be\\r\\neven weakening her claims, was hard to bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne\\'s good offices\\r\\nwith Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation of their\\r\\nmarriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but on\\r\\nbeing assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature, since\\r\\nhe did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that\\r\\nsomething might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he\\r\\nloved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne\\'s feelings,\\r\\nas far as the observances due to Mr Elliot\\'s character would allow,\\r\\nwhen Anne\\'s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of\\r\\neverything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of\\r\\nsucceeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least the\\r\\ncomfort of telling the whole story her own way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not\\r\\nbut express some surprise at Mrs Smith\\'s having spoken of him so\\r\\nfavourably in the beginning of their conversation.  \"She had seemed to\\r\\nrecommend and praise him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\\r\\nI considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet have\\r\\nmade the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he\\r\\nhad been your husband.  My heart bled for you, as I talked of\\r\\nhappiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a\\r\\nwoman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.  He was very unkind to\\r\\nhis first wife.  They were wretched together.  But she was too ignorant\\r\\nand giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.  I was willing to\\r\\nhope that you must fare better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having\\r\\nbeen induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea of the\\r\\nmisery which must have followed.  It was just possible that she might\\r\\nhave been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such a supposition,\\r\\nwhich would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, too\\r\\nlate?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;\\r\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\\r\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, that\\r\\nAnne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative\\r\\nto Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point, her\\r\\nfeelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.  There was no\\r\\nlonger anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as opposed to\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evil\\r\\nof his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he might have\\r\\ndone, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.  Pity\\r\\nfor him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.  In every\\r\\nother respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward, she saw\\r\\nmore to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned for the\\r\\ndisappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling; for the\\r\\nmortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister, and\\r\\nhad all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how to\\r\\navert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own knowledge of\\r\\nhim.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not\\r\\nslighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeed\\r\\nspringing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one\\r\\nelse could have done.  Could the knowledge have been extended through\\r\\nher family?  But this was a vain idea.  She must talk to Lady Russell,\\r\\ntell her, consult with her, and having done her best, wait the event\\r\\nwith as much composure as possible; and after all, her greatest want of\\r\\ncomposure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be\\r\\nopened to Lady Russell; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must\\r\\nbe all to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended, escaped\\r\\nseeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them a long morning\\r\\nvisit; but hardly had she congratulated herself, and felt safe, when\\r\\nshe heard that he was coming again in the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth, with\\r\\naffected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints; so Mrs Clay says, at\\r\\nleast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for\\r\\nan invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him; for your\\r\\nhard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game to\\r\\nbe soon overcome by a gentleman\\'s hints.  However, when I found how\\r\\nexcessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this\\r\\nmorning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an\\r\\nopportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to so\\r\\nmuch advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so\\r\\npleasantly.  Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however, to turn her\\r\\neyes towards Anne.  \"Exactly like father and son!  Dear Miss Elliot,\\r\\nmay I not say father and son?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body\\'s words.  If you will have such\\r\\nideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\r\\nbeing beyond those of other men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\\r\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.  I did\\r\\ninvite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.  When I found he\\r\\nwas really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day\\r\\nto-morrow, I had compassion on him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such\\r\\npleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of\\r\\nthe very person whose presence must really be interfering with her\\r\\nprime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight\\r\\nof Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging, placid look,\\r\\nand appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting\\r\\nherself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done\\r\\notherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the\\r\\nroom; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.  She had\\r\\nbeen used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, but\\r\\nnow she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference to her\\r\\nfather, contrasted with his former language, was odious; and when she\\r\\nthought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith, she could hardly bear\\r\\nthe sight of his present smiles and mildness, or the sound of his\\r\\nartificial good sentiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a\\r\\nremonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape all\\r\\nenquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to\\r\\nhim as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as\\r\\nquietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\r\\nbeen gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded, and more\\r\\ncool, than she had been the night before.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could\\r\\nhave heard her formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified by\\r\\nmore solicitation; but the charm was broken: he found that the heat and\\r\\nanimation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin\\'s\\r\\nvanity; he found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any of\\r\\nthose attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of\\r\\nthe others.  He little surmised that it was a subject acting now\\r\\nexactly against his interest, bringing immediately to her thoughts all\\r\\nthose parts of his conduct which were least excusable.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of\\r\\nBath the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the\\r\\ngreater part of two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the\\r\\nvery evening of his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his\\r\\nabsence was certain.  It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be\\r\\nalways before her; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their\\r\\nparty, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.  It\\r\\nwas so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on\\r\\nher father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources of\\r\\nmortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay\\'s selfishness was not so\\r\\ncomplicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded for\\r\\nthe marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot\\'s\\r\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell, and\\r\\naccomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\\r\\ndirectly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some\\r\\nobliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which determined her to\\r\\nwait till she might be safe from such a companion.  She saw Mrs Clay\\r\\nfairly off, therefore, before she began to talk of spending the morning\\r\\nin Rivers Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love.  Oh!\\r\\nyou may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, and\\r\\npretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself for\\r\\never with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\\r\\nLady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.  You need not\\r\\ntell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.  I used\\r\\nto think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her at the\\r\\nconcert.  Something so formal and _arrang\\xe9_ in her air!  and she sits so\\r\\nupright!  My best love, of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And mine,\" added Sir Walter.  \"Kindest regards.  And you may say, that\\r\\nI mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message; but I shall only\\r\\nleave my card.  Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of\\r\\nlife, who make themselves up so little.  If she would only wear rouge\\r\\nshe would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I\\r\\nobserved the blinds were let down immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it\\r\\nbe?  Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr\\r\\nElliot, would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven\\r\\nmiles off.  After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of\\r\\napproach were heard, and \"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove\" were ushered\\r\\ninto the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Anne\\r\\nwas really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but that\\r\\nthey could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became\\r\\nclear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with any\\r\\nviews of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were\\r\\nable to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.  They\\r\\nwere come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at the\\r\\nWhite Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood; but till Sir Walter\\r\\nand Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing-room, and\\r\\nregaling themselves with her admiration, Anne could not draw upon\\r\\nCharles\\'s brain for a regular history of their coming, or an\\r\\nexplanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which had\\r\\nbeen ostentatiously dropped by Mary, as well as of some apparent\\r\\nconfusion as to whom their party consisted of.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta, and\\r\\nCaptain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,\\r\\nintelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw a great\\r\\ndeal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme had received its\\r\\nfirst impulse by Captain Harville\\'s wanting to come to Bath on\\r\\nbusiness.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doing\\r\\nsomething, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed coming with him,\\r\\nand Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as an\\r\\nadvantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear to be left, and had\\r\\nmade herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything\\r\\nseemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then, it had been taken up\\r\\nby his father and mother.  His mother had some old friends in Bath whom\\r\\nshe wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to\\r\\ncome and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister; and, in short,\\r\\nit ended in being his mother\\'s party, that everything might be\\r\\ncomfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included\\r\\nin it by way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night\\r\\nbefore.  Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with\\r\\nMr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne\\'s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\r\\nfor Henrietta\\'s wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined such\\r\\ndifficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage\\r\\nfrom being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that, very\\r\\nrecently, (since Mary\\'s last letter to herself), Charles Hayter had\\r\\nbeen applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not\\r\\npossibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of his\\r\\npresent income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent\\r\\nlong before the term in question, the two families had consented to the\\r\\nyoung people\\'s wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place\\r\\nin a few months, quite as soon as Louisa\\'s.  \"And a very good living it\\r\\nwas,\" Charles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and\\r\\nin a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire.  In the centre of\\r\\nsome of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great\\r\\nproprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two\\r\\nof the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a special\\r\\nrecommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,\" he observed,\\r\\n\"Charles is too cool about sporting. That\\'s the worst of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried Anne, \"particularly glad that this\\r\\nshould happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well,\\r\\nand who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of\\r\\none should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be so\\r\\nequal in their prosperity and comfort.  I hope your father and mother\\r\\nare quite happy with regard to both.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were\\r\\nricher, but he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming\\r\\ndown with money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable\\r\\noperation, and it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do not\\r\\nmean to say they have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should\\r\\nhave daughters\\' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,\\r\\nliberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta\\'s match.\\r\\nShe never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice, nor think\\r\\nenough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to the value of the\\r\\nproperty.  It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked\\r\\nCharles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne,\\r\\n\"should be happy in their children\\'s marriages.  They do everything to\\r\\nconfer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people to be in\\r\\nsuch hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those\\r\\nambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery,\\r\\nboth in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much\\r\\nrecovered; but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no\\r\\nlaughing or dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to\\r\\nshut the door a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young\\r\\ndab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses,\\r\\nor whispering to her, all day long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne could not help laughing.  \"That cannot be much to your taste, I\\r\\nknow,\" said she; \"but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am\\r\\nso illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\r\\npleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one\\r\\ncan but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done\\r\\nhim no harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.\\r\\nI got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.  We\\r\\nhad a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father\\'s great\\r\\nbarns; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better\\r\\never since.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles\\'s\\r\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heard\\r\\nenough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in\\r\\nits happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced, her sigh had none\\r\\nof the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly have risen to their\\r\\nblessings if she could, but she did not want to lessen theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was in\\r\\nexcellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well\\r\\nsatisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law\\'s carriage with four\\r\\nhorses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place, that\\r\\nshe was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought, and\\r\\nenter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they\\r\\nwere detailed to her.  She had no demands on her father or sister, and\\r\\nher consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\r\\ndrawing-rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.  She felt that\\r\\nMrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them; but\\r\\nshe could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction of\\r\\nservants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had been\\r\\nalways so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.  It was a struggle\\r\\nbetween propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then\\r\\nElizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions: \"Old\\r\\nfashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give\\r\\ndinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not even\\r\\nask her own sister\\'s family, though they were here a month: and I dare\\r\\nsay it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put her quite out of\\r\\nher way.  I am sure she would rather not come; she cannot feel easy\\r\\nwith us.  I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better;\\r\\nthat will be a novelty and a treat.  They have not seen two such\\r\\ndrawing rooms before.  They will be delighted to come to-morrow\\r\\nevening.  It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant.\"  And\\r\\nthis satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation was given to the two\\r\\npresent, and promised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied.\\r\\nShe was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady\\r\\nDalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to\\r\\ncome; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention.\\r\\nMiss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the\\r\\ncourse of the morning; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go\\r\\nand see her and Henrietta directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.\\r\\nThey all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; but\\r\\nAnne convinced herself that a day\\'s delay of the intended communication\\r\\ncould be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart, to\\r\\nsee again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with an\\r\\neagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves, and\\r\\nAnne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly in that\\r\\nstate of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made\\r\\nher full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before\\r\\nat all; and Mrs Musgrove\\'s real affection had been won by her\\r\\nusefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness, and a\\r\\nwarmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sad\\r\\nwant of such blessings at home.  She was entreated to give them as much\\r\\nof her time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or\\r\\nrather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she naturally\\r\\nfell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on\\r\\nCharles\\'s leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove\\'s\\r\\nhistory of Louisa, and to Henrietta\\'s of herself, giving opinions on\\r\\nbusiness, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\\r\\nwhich Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\\r\\nfrom finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying to\\r\\nconvince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, well\\r\\namused as she generally was, in her station at a window overlooking the\\r\\nentrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her moments of imagining.\\r\\n\\r\\nA morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party in\\r\\nan hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes\\r\\nbrought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an\\r\\nhour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half\\r\\nfilled:  a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove,\\r\\nand Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth.  The\\r\\nappearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the\\r\\nmoment.  It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this\\r\\narrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together\\r\\nagain.  Their last meeting had been most important in opening his\\r\\nfeelings; she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she\\r\\nfeared from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\\r\\nhastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.  He did not\\r\\nseem to want to be near enough for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried\\r\\nto dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\"Surely, if\\r\\nthere be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand\\r\\neach other ere long.  We are not boy and girl, to be captiously\\r\\nirritable, misled by every moment\\'s inadvertence, and wantonly playing\\r\\nwith our own happiness.\"  And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she felt\\r\\nas if their being in company with each other, under their present\\r\\ncircumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and\\r\\nmisconstructions of the most mischievous kind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anne,\" cried Mary, still at her window, \"there is Mrs Clay, I am sure,\\r\\nstanding under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.  I saw them\\r\\nturn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed deep in talk.\\r\\nWho is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.  It is Mr\\r\\nElliot himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.  He\\r\\nwas to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till\\r\\nto-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her, the\\r\\nconsciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\\r\\nthat she had said so much, simple as it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\\r\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\\r\\nstill more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne to\\r\\ncome and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir, and tried to\\r\\nbe cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned, however, on perceiving\\r\\nsmiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady\\r\\nvisitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret.  It was\\r\\nevident that the report concerning her had spread, and a short pause\\r\\nsucceeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do come, Anne,\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself.  You will be too\\r\\nlate if you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking\\r\\nhands.  He is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to\\r\\nhave forgot all about Lyme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment, Anne did move\\r\\nquietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain that it\\r\\nreally was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed, before he\\r\\ndisappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other;\\r\\nand checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an\\r\\nappearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally\\r\\nopposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot, certainly.\\r\\nHe has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be\\r\\nmistaken, I might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\\r\\nrecomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself\\r\\nwell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them\\r\\noff, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began\\r\\nwith--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.  I\\r\\nhave been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.  A\\'n\\'t\\r\\nI a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\\r\\nIt holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will not be\\r\\nsorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.  Have not I done\\r\\nwell, mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect\\r\\nreadiness for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when\\r\\nMary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?  Take a box\\r\\nfor to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden\\r\\nPlace to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked to meet\\r\\nLady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all the principal\\r\\nfamily connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?  How can you be\\r\\nso forgetful?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" replied Charles, \"what\\'s an evening party?  Never worth\\r\\nremembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if he\\r\\nhad wanted to see us.  You may do as you like, but I shall go to the\\r\\nplay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you\\r\\npromised to go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word\\r\\n\\'happy.\\'  There was no promise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.  We were\\r\\nasked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always such a great\\r\\nconnexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.  Nothing ever happened\\r\\non either side that was not announced immediately.  We are quite near\\r\\nrelations, you know; and Mr Elliot too, whom you ought so particularly\\r\\nto be acquainted with!  Every attention is due to Mr Elliot.  Consider,\\r\\nmy father\\'s heir:  the future representative of the family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried Charles.  \"I\\r\\nam not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising\\r\\nsun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it\\r\\nscandalous to go for the sake of his heir.  What is Mr Elliot to me?\"\\r\\nThe careless expression was life to Anne, who saw that Captain\\r\\nWentworth was all attention, looking and listening with his whole soul;\\r\\nand that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\\r\\nand half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\\r\\ninvariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make\\r\\nit known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, she\\r\\nshould not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\\r\\nwithout her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back and\\r\\nchange the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided, and we\\r\\nshould be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father\\'s;\\r\\nand I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,\\r\\nif Miss Anne could not be with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much so\\r\\nfor the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it depended only on my inclination, ma\\'am, the party at home\\r\\n(excepting on Mary\\'s account) would not be the smallest impediment.  I\\r\\nhave no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to\\r\\nchange it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better not be\\r\\nattempted, perhaps.\"  She had spoken it; but she trembled when it was\\r\\ndone, conscious that her words were listened to, and daring not even to\\r\\ntry to observe their effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Charles\\r\\nonly reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife, by persisting\\r\\nthat he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place; probably\\r\\nfor the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking a\\r\\nstation, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have not been long enough in Bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy the evening\\r\\nparties of the place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.  I am no\\r\\ncard-player.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards; but\\r\\ntime makes many changes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not yet so much changed,\" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she\\r\\nhardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments he said,\\r\\nand as if it were the result of immediate feeling, \"It is a period,\\r\\nindeed!  Eight years and a half is a period.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne\\'s imagination\\r\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds he\\r\\nhad uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta, eager to\\r\\nmake use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on her\\r\\ncompanions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready, and\\r\\ntried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the\\r\\nregret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair, in preparing\\r\\nto quit the room, she would have found, in all her own sensations for\\r\\nher cousin, in the very security of his affection, wherewith to pity\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds were\\r\\nheard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Sir\\r\\nWalter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill.\\r\\nAnne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked saw symptoms\\r\\nof the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was\\r\\nover, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk,\\r\\nto meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.  How\\r\\nmortifying to feel that it was so!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth was\\r\\nacknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.\\r\\nShe even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\\r\\nElizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel\\r\\nexplained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper\\r\\nnothings, she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all\\r\\nthe remaining dues of the Musgroves.  \"To-morrow evening, to meet a few\\r\\nfriends:  no formal party.\" It was all said very gracefully, and the\\r\\ncards with which she had provided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\"\\r\\nwere laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all,\\r\\nand one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The\\r\\ntruth was, that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand\\r\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.  The past\\r\\nwas nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about\\r\\nwell in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given, and Sir Walter\\r\\nand Elizabeth arose and disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\\r\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but not\\r\\nto Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had with such\\r\\nastonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had been\\r\\nreceived; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than\\r\\ngratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.  She\\r\\nknew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\\r\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement for\\r\\nall the insolence of the past.  Her spirits sank.  He held the card in\\r\\nhis hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only think of Elizabeth\\'s including everybody!\" whispered Mary very\\r\\naudibly.  \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!  You see he\\r\\ncannot put the card out of his hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\\r\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she\\r\\nmight neither see nor hear more to vex her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies\\r\\nproceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Anne\\r\\nbelonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine, and\\r\\ngive them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been so long\\r\\nexerted that at present she felt unequal to more, and fit only for\\r\\nhome, where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose.\\r\\n\\r\\nPromising to be with them the whole of the following morning,\\r\\ntherefore, she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to\\r\\nCamden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the\\r\\nbusy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow\\'s party, the\\r\\nfrequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually\\r\\nimproving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the\\r\\nmost completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself\\r\\nwith the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come\\r\\nor not?  They were reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a\\r\\ngnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together.  She\\r\\ngenerally thought he would come, because she generally thought he\\r\\nought; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive\\r\\nact of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of\\r\\nvery opposite feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\\r\\nto let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours\\r\\nafter his being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vain\\r\\nfor some intimation of the interview from the lady herself, she\\r\\ndetermined to mention it, and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs\\r\\nClay\\'s face as she listened.  It was transient: cleared away in an\\r\\ninstant; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of\\r\\nhaving, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearing\\r\\nauthority of his, been obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) to\\r\\nhis lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter.  She\\r\\nexclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise I\\r\\nmet with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.  He\\r\\nturned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been prevented\\r\\nsetting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a\\r\\nhurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his being\\r\\ndetermined not to be delayed in his return.  He wanted to know how\\r\\nearly he might be admitted to-morrow.  He was full of \\'to-morrow,\\' and\\r\\nit is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I\\r\\nentered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that\\r\\nhad happened, or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of\\r\\nmy head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day only had passed since Anne\\'s conversation with Mrs Smith; but a\\r\\nkeener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by Mr\\r\\nElliot\\'s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became\\r\\na matter of course the next morning, still to defer her explanatory\\r\\nvisit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be with the Musgroves from\\r\\nbreakfast to dinner.  Her faith was plighted, and Mr Elliot\\'s\\r\\ncharacter, like the Sultaness Scheherazade\\'s head, must live another\\r\\nday.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not keep her appointment punctually, however; the weather was\\r\\nunfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain on her friends\\'\\r\\naccount, and felt it very much on her own, before she was able to\\r\\nattempt the walk.  When she reached the White Hart, and made her way to\\r\\nthe proper apartment, she found herself neither arriving quite in time,\\r\\nnor the first to arrive.  The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove,\\r\\ntalking to Mrs Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and\\r\\nshe immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait,\\r\\nhad gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon,\\r\\nand that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to\\r\\nkeep her there till they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,\\r\\nbe outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once in all the\\r\\nagitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little\\r\\nbefore the morning closed.  There was no delay, no waste of time.  She\\r\\nwas deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such\\r\\nhappiness, instantly.  Two minutes after her entering the room, Captain\\r\\nWentworth said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now, if you\\r\\nwill give me materials.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMaterials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it, and nearly\\r\\nturning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter\\'s\\r\\nengagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was\\r\\nperfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.  Anne felt that\\r\\nshe did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville\\r\\nseemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing\\r\\nmany undesirable particulars; such as, \"how Mr Musgrove and my brother\\r\\nHayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter\\r\\nhad said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what\\r\\nhad occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished,\\r\\nand what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards\\r\\npersuaded to think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same\\r\\nstyle of open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every\\r\\nadvantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not\\r\\ngive, could be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft\\r\\nwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it\\r\\nwas very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much\\r\\nself-occupied to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so, ma\\'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in her\\r\\npowerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different, yet,\\r\\naltogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for\\r\\nCharles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near\\r\\nas bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the\\r\\nbest of it, as many others have done before them.  At any rate, said I,\\r\\nit will be better than a long engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is precisely what I was going to observe,\" cried Mrs Croft.  \"I\\r\\nwould rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and\\r\\nhave to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in\\r\\na long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! dear Mrs Croft,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her finish her\\r\\nspeech, \"there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long\\r\\nengagement.  It is what I always protested against for my children.  It\\r\\nis all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if\\r\\nthere is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or\\r\\neven in twelve; but a long engagement--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, dear ma\\'am,\" said Mrs Croft, \"or an uncertain engagement, an\\r\\nengagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing that at such a\\r\\ntime there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and\\r\\nunwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne found an unexpected interest here.  She felt its application to\\r\\nherself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same\\r\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,\\r\\nlistening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, one\\r\\nquick, conscious look at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,\\r\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary\\r\\npractice as had fallen within their observation, but Anne heard nothing\\r\\ndistinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was in\\r\\nconfusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now left\\r\\nhis seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him, though\\r\\nit was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he\\r\\nwas inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her with a\\r\\nsmile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, \"Come to me, I\\r\\nhave something to say;\" and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner\\r\\nwhich denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was,\\r\\nstrongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself and went to him.\\r\\nThe window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from\\r\\nwhere the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to Captain\\r\\nWentworth\\'s table, not very near.  As she joined him, Captain\\r\\nHarville\\'s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression\\r\\nwhich seemed its natural character.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying a\\r\\nsmall miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly:  Captain Benwick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,\" (in a deep tone,) \"it was\\r\\nnot done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our walking together at\\r\\nLyme, and grieving for him?  I little thought then--but no matter.\\r\\nThis was drawn at the Cape.  He met with a clever young German artist\\r\\nat the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to\\r\\nhim, and was bringing it home for her; and I have now the charge of\\r\\ngetting it properly set for another!  It was a commission to me!  But\\r\\nwho else was there to employ?  I hope I can allow for him.  I am not\\r\\nsorry, indeed, to make it over to another.  He undertakes it;\" (looking\\r\\ntowards Captain Wentworth,) \"he is writing about it now.\"  And with a\\r\\nquivering lip he wound up the whole by adding, \"Poor Fanny! she would\\r\\nnot have forgotten him so soon!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"That I can easily\\r\\nbelieve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not in her nature.  She doted on him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Harville smiled, as much as to say, \"Do you claim that for your\\r\\nsex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also, \"Yes.  We certainly\\r\\ndo not forget you as soon as you forget us.  It is, perhaps, our fate\\r\\nrather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.  We live at home,\\r\\nquiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.  You are forced on\\r\\nexertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some\\r\\nsort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and\\r\\ncontinual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\r\\n(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to\\r\\nBenwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace turned\\r\\nhim on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us, in our\\r\\nlittle family circle, ever since.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Anne, \"very true; I did not recollect; but what shall we\\r\\nsay now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from outward\\r\\ncircumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man\\'s nature,\\r\\nwhich has done the business for Captain Benwick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, it is not man\\'s nature.  I will not allow it to be more man\\'s\\r\\nnature than woman\\'s to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or\\r\\nhave loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy\\r\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\\r\\nthe strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough\\r\\nusage, and riding out the heaviest weather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same\\r\\nspirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most\\r\\ntender.  Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\\r\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\\r\\nNay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.  You have\\r\\ndifficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.  You\\r\\nare always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\\r\\nYour home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,\\r\\nnor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed\" (with a\\r\\nfaltering voice), \"if woman\\'s feelings were to be added to all this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall never agree upon this question,\" Captain Harville was\\r\\nbeginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to Captain\\r\\nWentworth\\'s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.  It was\\r\\nnothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was startled\\r\\nat finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined to\\r\\nsuspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by\\r\\nthem, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think he could\\r\\nhave caught.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you finished your letter?\" said Captain Harville.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.  I am\\r\\nin very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied, and\\r\\nwant for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,\"\\r\\n(lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose,\\r\\nupon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.  But let me\\r\\nobserve that all histories are against you--all stories, prose and\\r\\nverse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty\\r\\nquotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I\\r\\never opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon\\r\\nwoman\\'s inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman\\'s\\r\\nfickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in\\r\\nbooks.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\\r\\nEducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been\\r\\nin their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how shall we prove anything?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a\\r\\npoint.  It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\\r\\nWe each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and\\r\\nupon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has\\r\\noccurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps\\r\\nthose very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as\\r\\ncannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some\\r\\nrespect saying what should not be said.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, \"if I could\\r\\nbut make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at\\r\\nhis wife and children, and watches the boat that he has sent them off\\r\\nin, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, \\'God knows\\r\\nwhether we ever meet again!\\' And then, if I could convey to you the\\r\\nglow of his soul when he does see them again; when, coming back after a\\r\\ntwelvemonth\\'s absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port,\\r\\nhe calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to\\r\\ndeceive himself, and saying, \\'They cannot be here till such a day,\\' but\\r\\nall the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them\\r\\narrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner\\r\\nstill!  If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear\\r\\nand do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his\\r\\nexistence!  I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\"\\r\\npressing his own with emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by\\r\\nyou, and by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should\\r\\nundervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my\\r\\nfellow-creatures!  I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to\\r\\nsuppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman.\\r\\nNo, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married\\r\\nlives.  I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every\\r\\ndomestic forbearance, so long as--if I may be allowed the\\r\\nexpression--so long as you have an object.  I mean while the woman you\\r\\nlove lives, and lives for you.  All the privilege I claim for my own\\r\\nsex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of\\r\\nloving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart was\\r\\ntoo full, her breath too much oppressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a good soul,\" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand on her\\r\\narm, quite affectionately.  \"There is no quarrelling with you.  And\\r\\nwhen I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking\\r\\nleave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,\" said she.  \"I am\\r\\ngoing home, and you have an engagement with your friend.  To-night we\\r\\nmay have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\" (turning to\\r\\nAnne.)  \"We had your sister\\'s card yesterday, and I understood\\r\\nFrederick had a card too, though I did not see it; and you are\\r\\ndisengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either\\r\\ncould not or would not answer fully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but Harville and I shall\\r\\nsoon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready, I am in half a\\r\\nminute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.  I shall be at your\\r\\nservice in half a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter\\r\\nwith great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitated\\r\\nair, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how to\\r\\nunderstand it.  She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\" from\\r\\nCaptain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!  He had passed\\r\\nout of the room without a look!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had only time, however, to move closer to the table where he had\\r\\nbeen writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, it\\r\\nwas himself.  He begged their pardon, but he had forgotten his gloves,\\r\\nand instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he drew out a\\r\\nletter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anne with eyes\\r\\nof glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time, and hastily collecting his\\r\\ngloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware\\r\\nof his being in it: the work of an instant!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost beyond\\r\\nexpression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to \"Miss A.\\r\\nE.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily.\\r\\nWhile supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick, he had been also\\r\\naddressing her!  On the contents of that letter depended all which this\\r\\nworld could do for her.  Anything was possible, anything might be\\r\\ndefied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of\\r\\nher own at her own table; to their protection she must trust, and\\r\\nsinking into the chair which he had occupied, succeeding to the very\\r\\nspot where he had leaned and written, her eyes devoured the following\\r\\nwords:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means\\r\\nas are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony, half\\r\\nhope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are\\r\\ngone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your\\r\\nown than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago.  Dare\\r\\nnot say that man forgets sooner than  woman, that his love has an\\r\\nearlier death.  I have loved none but you.  Unjust I may have been,\\r\\nweak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant.  You alone have\\r\\nbrought me to Bath.  For you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not\\r\\nseen this?  Can you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not\\r\\nwaited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think\\r\\nyou must have penetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant\\r\\nhearing something which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can\\r\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\\r\\nToo good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.  You do\\r\\nbelieve that there is true attachment and constancy among men.  Believe\\r\\nit to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow\\r\\nyour party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look, will be enough to\\r\\ndecide whether I enter your father\\'s house this evening or never.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half an hour\\'s\\r\\nsolitude and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten\\r\\nminutes only which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the\\r\\nrestraints of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.\\r\\nEvery moment rather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering\\r\\nhappiness.  And before she was beyond the first stage of full\\r\\nsensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an\\r\\nimmediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.  She began\\r\\nnot to understand a word they said, and was obliged to plead\\r\\nindisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see that she looked\\r\\nvery ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without her\\r\\nfor the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only have gone away, and\\r\\nleft her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her\\r\\ncure; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was\\r\\ndistracting, and in desperation, she said she would go home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly, and\\r\\ntake care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.  I wish\\r\\nSarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.  Charles, ring\\r\\nand order a chair.  She must not walk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility\\r\\nof speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,\\r\\nsolitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting\\r\\nhim) could not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,\\r\\nand Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, having\\r\\nassured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the\\r\\ncase; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow\\r\\non her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall;\\r\\ncould part with her cheerfully, and depend on finding her better at\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, ma\\'am, that it is not perfectly understood.  Pray be so\\r\\ngood as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your\\r\\nwhole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been some mistake; and\\r\\nI wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain\\r\\nWentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.  Captain\\r\\nHarville has no thought but of going.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.\\r\\nWill you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?  You will\\r\\nsee them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain\\r\\nHarville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne\\'s message.  But indeed,\\r\\nmy dear, you need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite\\r\\nengaged, I\\'ll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare\\r\\nsay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp\\r\\nthe perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting, however.\\r\\nEven if he did not come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her\\r\\npower to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville.  Another\\r\\nmomentary vexation occurred.  Charles, in his real concern and good\\r\\nnature, would go home with her; there was no preventing him.  This was\\r\\nalmost cruel.  But she could not be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing\\r\\nan engagement at a gunsmith\\'s, to be of use to her; and she set off\\r\\nwith him, with no feeling but gratitude apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something of\\r\\nfamiliar sound, gave her two moments\\' preparation for the sight of\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to\\r\\njoin or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.  Anne could command\\r\\nherself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively.  The cheeks\\r\\nwhich had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitated\\r\\nwere decided.  He walked by her side.  Presently, struck by a sudden\\r\\nthought, Charles said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street, or\\r\\nfarther up the town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?\\r\\nBecause, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my\\r\\nplace, and give Anne your arm to her father\\'s door.  She is rather done\\r\\nfor this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to\\r\\nbe at that fellow\\'s in the Market Place.  He promised me the sight of a\\r\\ncapital gun he is just going to send off; said he would keep it\\r\\nunpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do\\r\\nnot turn back now, I have no chance.  By his description, a good deal\\r\\nlike the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day\\r\\nround Winthrop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere could not be an objection.  There could be only the most proper\\r\\nalacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined\\r\\nin and spirits dancing in private rapture.  In half a minute Charles\\r\\nwas at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding\\r\\ntogether:  and soon words enough had passed between them to decide\\r\\ntheir direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel\\r\\nwalk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a\\r\\nblessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the\\r\\nhappiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow.  There\\r\\nthey exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once\\r\\nbefore seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so\\r\\nmany, many years of division and estrangement.  There they returned\\r\\nagain into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their\\r\\nre-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more\\r\\ntried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other\\'s character, truth, and\\r\\nattachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as\\r\\nthey slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around\\r\\nthem, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\\r\\nflirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\\r\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those\\r\\nexplanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which\\r\\nwere so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little\\r\\nvariations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and\\r\\ntoday there could scarcely be an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding\\r\\nweight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate in the very\\r\\nhour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned, after a short\\r\\nsuspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him in\\r\\neverything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the last\\r\\nfour-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding to the better\\r\\nhopes which her looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; it\\r\\nhad been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which\\r\\nhad reached him while she talked with Captain Harville; and under the\\r\\nirresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper, and\\r\\npoured out his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\\r\\nHe persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been\\r\\nsupplanted.  He never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thus\\r\\nmuch indeed he was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant\\r\\nunconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her,\\r\\nand believed it to be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when\\r\\nhe had only been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because\\r\\nhe had been a sufferer from them.  Her character was now fixed on his\\r\\nmind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of\\r\\nfortitude and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only\\r\\nat Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he\\r\\nbegun to understand himself.  At Lyme, he had received lessons of more\\r\\nthan one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused\\r\\nhim, and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville\\'s had fixed her\\r\\nsuperiority.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove (the\\r\\nattempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever felt it to\\r\\nbe impossible; that he had not cared, could not care, for Louisa;\\r\\nthough till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed\\r\\nit, he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which\\r\\nLouisa\\'s could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold\\r\\nit possessed over his own.  There, he had learnt to distinguish between\\r\\nthe steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the\\r\\ndarings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind.  There\\r\\nhe had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had\\r\\nlost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of\\r\\nresentment, which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in\\r\\nhis way.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner been\\r\\nfree from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of\\r\\nLouisa\\'s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than he\\r\\nhad begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!\\r\\nThat neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual\\r\\nattachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree, I could\\r\\ncontradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others\\r\\nmight have felt the same--her own family, nay, perhaps herself--I was\\r\\nno longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour if she wished it.\\r\\nI had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously on this subject\\r\\nbefore.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its\\r\\ndanger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be\\r\\ntrying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the\\r\\nrisk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill\\r\\neffects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself; and that\\r\\nprecisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at\\r\\nall, he must regard himself as bound to her, if her sentiments for him\\r\\nwere what the Harvilles supposed.  It determined him to leave Lyme, and\\r\\nawait her complete recovery elsewhere.  He would gladly weaken, by any\\r\\nfair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might\\r\\nexist; and he went, therefore, to his brother\\'s, meaning after a while\\r\\nto return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.  I could\\r\\nhave no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you very\\r\\nparticularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little\\r\\nsuspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder for a\\r\\nreproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured, in her\\r\\neight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm of earlier\\r\\nyouth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to\\r\\nAnne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the\\r\\nresult, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own\\r\\npride, and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released\\r\\nfrom Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her\\r\\nengagement with Benwick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least\\r\\nput myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do\\r\\nsomething.  But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for\\r\\nevil, had been dreadful.  Within the first five minutes I said, \\'I will\\r\\nbe at Bath on Wednesday,\\' and I was.  Was it unpardonable to think it\\r\\nworth my while to come? and to arrive with some degree of hope?  You\\r\\nwere single.  It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the\\r\\npast, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine.  I could\\r\\nnever doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to\\r\\na certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better\\r\\npretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, \\'Was this\\r\\nfor me?\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the\\r\\nconcert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite\\r\\nmoments.  The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to\\r\\nspeak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot\\'s appearing and tearing her\\r\\naway, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope or\\r\\nincreasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be my\\r\\nwell-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,\\r\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!\\r\\nTo consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to\\r\\ninfluence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or\\r\\nindifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his!  Was it\\r\\nnot enough to make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look\\r\\non without agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind\\r\\nyou, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her\\r\\ninfluence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had\\r\\nonce done--was it not all against me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You should have distinguished,\" replied Anne.  \"You should not have\\r\\nsuspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.\\r\\nIf I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to\\r\\npersuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.  When I yielded,\\r\\nI thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here.  In\\r\\nmarrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred,\\r\\nand all duty violated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not.\\r\\nI could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of\\r\\nyour character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\\r\\nburied, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under\\r\\nyear after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who\\r\\nhad given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\\r\\nI saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of\\r\\nmisery.  I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  The\\r\\nforce of habit was to be added.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should have thought,\" said Anne, \"that my manner to yourself might\\r\\nhave spared you much or all of this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to\\r\\nanother man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet, I was\\r\\ndetermined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning, and\\r\\nI felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house\\r\\ncould have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other\\r\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, she\\r\\nre-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some\\r\\nmomentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.  An interval\\r\\nof meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective of\\r\\neverything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went to her\\r\\nroom, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her\\r\\nenjoyment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company\\r\\nassembled.  It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who\\r\\nhad never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace\\r\\nbusiness, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne\\r\\nhad never found an evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility\\r\\nand happiness, and more generally admired than she thought about or\\r\\ncared for, she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature\\r\\naround her.  Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\\r\\nThe Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple\\r\\nand Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.  She\\r\\ncared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in the public\\r\\nmanners of her father and sister.  With the Musgroves, there was the\\r\\nhappy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted\\r\\nintercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at\\r\\nconversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral\\r\\nand Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest,\\r\\nwhich the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain\\r\\nWentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and\\r\\nalways the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied in\\r\\nadmiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of\\r\\nthe right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe\\r\\nthat I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly\\r\\nright in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you\\r\\ndo now.  To me, she was in the place of a parent.  Do not mistake me,\\r\\nhowever.  I am not saying that she did not err in her advice.  It was,\\r\\nperhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the\\r\\nevent decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any\\r\\ncircumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean,\\r\\nthat I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done\\r\\notherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement\\r\\nthan I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my\\r\\nconscience.  I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in\\r\\nhuman nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a\\r\\nstrong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman\\'s portion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,\\r\\nreplied, as if in cool deliberation--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet.  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.  I trust\\r\\nto being in charity with her soon.  But I too have been thinking over\\r\\nthe past, and a  question has suggested itself, whether there may not\\r\\nhave been one person more my enemy even than that lady?  My own self.\\r\\nTell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few\\r\\nthousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written\\r\\nto you, would you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short, have\\r\\nrenewed the engagement then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would I!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God!\" he cried, \"you would!  It is not that I did not think of\\r\\nit, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but I\\r\\nwas proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.  I shut\\r\\nmy eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.  This is a\\r\\nrecollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than\\r\\nmyself.  Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared.\\r\\nIt is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.  I have been used to the\\r\\ngratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I\\r\\nenjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards.\\r\\nLike other great men under reverses,\" he added, with a smile. \"I must\\r\\nendeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.  I must learn to brook being\\r\\nhappier than I deserve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWho can be in doubt of what followed?  When any two young people take\\r\\nit into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to\\r\\ncarry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever\\r\\nso little likely to be necessary to each other\\'s ultimate comfort.\\r\\nThis may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be\\r\\ntruth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and\\r\\nan Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness\\r\\nof right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing\\r\\ndown every opposition?  They might in fact, have borne down a great\\r\\ndeal more than they met with, for there was little to distress them\\r\\nbeyond the want of graciousness and warmth.  Sir Walter made no\\r\\nobjection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and\\r\\nunconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds,\\r\\nand as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him,\\r\\nwas no longer nobody.  He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the\\r\\ndaughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet, who had not had principle\\r\\nor sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which\\r\\nProvidence had placed him, and who could give his daughter at present\\r\\nbut a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers\\r\\nhereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne, and no vanity\\r\\nflattered, to make him really happy on the occasion, was very far from\\r\\nthinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary, when he saw more of\\r\\nCaptain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well,\\r\\nhe was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his\\r\\nsuperiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her\\r\\nsuperiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name,\\r\\nenabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace,\\r\\nfor the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any\\r\\nserious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell must be\\r\\nsuffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot, and\\r\\nbe making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and do\\r\\njustice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what Lady Russell had\\r\\nnow to do.  She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with\\r\\nregard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in\\r\\neach; that because Captain Wentworth\\'s manners had not suited her own\\r\\nideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a\\r\\ncharacter of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliot\\'s\\r\\nmanners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness,\\r\\ntheir general politeness and suavity, she had been too quick in\\r\\nreceiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and\\r\\nwell-regulated mind.  There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do,\\r\\nthan to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up\\r\\na new set of opinions and of hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\\r\\nof character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in\\r\\nothers can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of\\r\\nunderstanding than her young friend.  But she was a very good woman,\\r\\nand if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging, her first\\r\\nwas to see Anne happy.  She loved Anne better than she loved her own\\r\\nabilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found\\r\\nlittle hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was\\r\\nsecuring the happiness of her other child.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\r\\nby the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married, and\\r\\nshe might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the\\r\\nconnexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn; and as her own\\r\\nsister must be better than her husband\\'s sisters, it was very agreeable\\r\\nthat Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain\\r\\nBenwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer, perhaps, when\\r\\nthey came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored to the rights of\\r\\nseniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a\\r\\nfuture to look forward to, of powerful consolation.  Anne had no\\r\\nUppercross Hall before her, no landed estate, no headship of a family;\\r\\nand if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet,\\r\\nshe would not change situations with Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\r\\nwith her situation, for a change is not very probable there.  She had\\r\\nsoon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw, and no one of\\r\\nproper condition has since presented himself to raise even the\\r\\nunfounded hopes which sunk with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news of his cousin Anne\\'s engagement burst on Mr Elliot most\\r\\nunexpectedly.  It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness, his\\r\\nbest hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a\\r\\nson-in-law\\'s rights would have given.  But, though discomfited and\\r\\ndisappointed, he could still do something for his own interest and his\\r\\nown enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay\\'s quitting it\\r\\nsoon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under his\\r\\nprotection in London, it was evident how double a game he had been\\r\\nplaying, and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out\\r\\nby one artful woman, at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Clay\\'s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had\\r\\nsacrificed, for the young man\\'s sake, the possibility of scheming\\r\\nlonger for Sir Walter.  She has abilities, however, as well as\\r\\naffections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or\\r\\nhers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from\\r\\nbeing the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at\\r\\nlast into making her the wife of Sir William.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and\\r\\nmortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of their\\r\\ndeception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resort\\r\\nto for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow\\r\\nothers, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of\\r\\nhalf enjoyment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell\\'s meaning to\\r\\nlove Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy to the\\r\\nhappiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of\\r\\nhaving no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\\r\\nThere she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion in\\r\\ntheir fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment\\'s regret; but\\r\\nto have no family to receive and estimate him properly, nothing of\\r\\nrespectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the\\r\\nworth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and\\r\\nsisters, was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be\\r\\nsensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity.  She had\\r\\nbut two friends in the world to add to his list, Lady Russell and Mrs\\r\\nSmith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed to attach himself.\\r\\nLady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions, he could now\\r\\nvalue from his heart.  While he was not obliged to say that he believed\\r\\nher to have been right in originally dividing them, he was ready to say\\r\\nalmost everything else in her favour, and as for Mrs Smith, she had\\r\\nclaims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves, and\\r\\ntheir marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend, secured her\\r\\ntwo.  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life; and Captain\\r\\nWentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering her husband\\'s\\r\\nproperty in the West Indies, by writing for her, acting for her, and\\r\\nseeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the\\r\\nactivity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend, fully\\r\\nrequited the services which she had rendered, or ever meant to render,\\r\\nto his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Smith\\'s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,\\r\\nwith some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends to\\r\\nbe often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail\\r\\nher; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have\\r\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.  She\\r\\nmight have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be\\r\\nhappy.  Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits, as her\\r\\nfriend Anne\\'s was in the warmth of her heart.  Anne was tenderness\\r\\nitself, and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth\\'s\\r\\naffection.  His profession was all that could ever make her friends\\r\\nwish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim\\r\\nher sunshine.  She gloried in being a sailor\\'s wife, but she must pay\\r\\nthe tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if\\r\\npossible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its\\r\\nnational importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFinis\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Persuasion, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PERSUASION ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 105.txt or 105.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/105/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Sharon Partridge and Martin Ward.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
